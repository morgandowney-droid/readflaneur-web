## Last Updated: 2026-02-23

Recent work: Improve Unsplash image quality with interleaved dual-query search (old approach searched "{name} {city}" with 10 results per query sequentially - new approach runs two parallel searches: "{name} {city}" for disambiguation + "{name}" alone for iconic/popular shots, 30 results each, interleaved and deduped so the final pool alternates city-accurate and visually striking photos; handles ambiguous names like SoHo across cities since city-qualified results take interleave priority; fallback to city-only and city+country queries preserved; 2 API calls per neighborhood well within 5000/hr budget), Fix monitor-and-fix auto-fixer starvation bug (getRetryableIssues fetched only 10 oldest issues - all stale unenriched_brief from Feb 16 - and the route if/else chain was missing handlers for unenriched_brief and missing_hyperlinks so they fell through to skip, causing 1,544 issues to accumulate unresolved; fixed by increasing query limit to 50 with 7-day max age filter and newest-first ordering, adding unenriched_brief/missing_hyperlinks handlers with enrichment rate limiting via new FIX_CONFIG.MAX_ENRICHMENTS_PER_RUN=5, simplifying the dispatch loop to route all fixable types through attemptFix() instead of duplicating type dispatch, and bulk-closing stale issues older than 5 days via migration), Shorten Look Ahead link text from "today and next 7 days" to "next 7 days" across all surfaces (DailyBriefTemplate, SundayEditionTemplate, BriefDiscoveryFooter, assembler cleanCategoryLabel, translations.ts feed.lookAhead and feed.lookAheadCta in all 9 languages), Change Sunday Edition house ad CTA from "Place it Now" to "Place it" in all 9 languages (translations.ts houseAd.sunday_edition.cta), Add information gap teaser to Sunday Edition email subject (Gemini generates 1-4 word cryptic teaser during editorialSynthesis stored in `weekly_briefs.subject_teaser` - zero extra API calls since it's appended to the existing editorial synthesis prompt as a TEASER: line, sender prefers Gemini teaser over headline-based fallback, format matches Daily Brief: `{teaser}, {neighborhood}` all lowercase, fallback `your sunday edition, {neighborhood}`, both send-sunday-edition cron and sunday-edition-request endpoint updated, DB migration adds subject_teaser column to weekly_briefs), Change Daily Brief subject line to lowercase teaser-first format (old "Daily Brief: West Village. Toughest table" wasted 25+ chars on prefix causing truncation, new format "toughest table, west village" puts teaser first with comma separator all lowercase, no "Daily Brief:" prefix, fallback "your morning brief, {neighborhood}", removed "& more" suffix from headline fallback), Replace real ad images with 8 AI-generated placeholder creatives (Emerald Dunes Links golf, Matterhorn Grand ski hotel, Aethelred Yachts, Aether Jets, AURA Z-Fold electronics, Important Property real estate, St Morgan restaurant, AURUM sunglasses - uploaded to Supabase ad-assets bucket as global active paid ads valid for 1 year, 7 daily_brief + 1 sunday_edition placement, expired 2 old Unsplash stock image ads, tagged customer_email placeholder@readflaneur.com for bulk management, upload script at scripts/upload-placeholder-ads.mjs), Fix Look Ahead event listing font jarring (EventListingBlock in ArticleBody.tsx used text-xs/text-sm sans-serif while prose used text-[1.35rem] Merriweather serif - bumped event listing to serif font with text-sm headers and text-[0.95rem] events for smooth transition), Relax tourist filter to stop suppressing legitimate events (broad "any activity primarily marketed to tourists" language caused Grok to self-censor in tourist-heavy neighborhoods like SoHo producing Look Ahead with only 1 event for a whole week - narrowed to specific exclusion list and explicitly encouraged galleries, exhibitions, concerts, pop-ups etc), Fix markdown links rendering as raw text in Daily Brief cards (extractSectionHeader heuristic splits words on whitespace so markdown links like [Bar Maeda](url) get broken across header/rest boundary - now skips header detection entirely when paragraph contains markdown links, this is a rendering bug not a data bug so DB health checks can't catch it), Add anchor links from Look Ahead event listing to day headers (clickable day headers in "At a glance" section smooth-scroll to corresponding day section in prose body below, daySlug() helper generates deterministic IDs, stopPropagation prevents card collapse, hover:text-accent visual hint), Persist active pill selection across browser back navigation (MultiFeed saves activeFilter to sessionStorage so returning from an article page restores the neighborhood pill instead of defaulting to "All Neighborhoods" view, validates saved ID exists in current neighborhoods list, session-scoped via sessionStorage not localStorage), Stop generating briefs and look-aheads for combo component neighborhoods (Djurgarden was getting its own independent daily brief and look-ahead despite being a component of the Ostermalm combo - migration sets is_active=false for all combo components via combo_neighborhoods table, archives incorrectly generated component articles, added combo_neighborhoods exclusion guard in both sync-neighborhood-briefs and generate-look-ahead crons as belt-and-suspenders), Add tourist activity filter to Daily Brief prompts (walking tours, food tours etc excluded from both Grok and Gemini enrichment prompts matching existing Look Ahead filter), Fix Sunday Edition data point headline overlap (dataPointValue style missing lineHeight causing 36px Playfair Display text to overlap on multi-line wrapping in mobile email clients, added lineHeight 1.2), Fix Daily Brief and Look Ahead card appearance (Daily Brief preview now skips AI greeting paragraph like "Morning, neighbors." and shows actual news content via isGreetingParagraph() covering all 9 languages, Look Ahead closed state puts "Read more" on its own line for cleaner layout, Look Ahead expanded state shows highlighted summary block at top with bg-canvas/50 rounded-lg before event listing), Sunday Edition admin test page (one-click generate/preview/send for any neighborhood on any day at /admin/sunday-edition, preview endpoint renders full email HTML with subject line, article URL safety fix verifies article exists before constructing "Read the full edition" link in both send-sunday-edition and sunday-edition-request endpoints), Fix Sunday Edition data point voice and past holiday detection (Data Point prompts changed from "we/our" possessive to neighborhood name references - "The Tribeca median listing" not "Our median listing", detectUpcomingHoliday now anchored to publication weekDate instead of generation time preventing past holidays like Mardi Gras from appearing in later editions), Fix Sunday Edition throughput (concurrency 3->5, schedule extended to Saturday+Sunday hourly so all 270 neighborhoods get briefs before Sunday morning sends), Morning Brew-style information gap email subject lines (Gemini generates 1-4 word cryptic teasers during enrichment stored in `neighborhood_briefs.subject_teaser` - zero extra API calls, sender prefers Gemini teaser over headline-based fallback, format: "Daily Brief: {Neighborhood}. {teaser}" e.g. "Daily Brief: West Village. Rent freeze showdown"), Silence GoTrue AbortError in Sentry (navigator.locks 'signal is aborted without reason' added to ignoreErrors), Disable Civic Data story generation (removed 5 crons from vercel.json - generate-nyc-weekly-digest, generate-global-weekly-digest, sync-global-permits, sync-global-liquor, sync-global-crime; archived 23 existing published articles), Change advertise house ad CTA to "Place It", Fix article back link going to /city/neighborhood instead of /feed (BackToFeedLink and MoreStoriesButton now always link to /feed so readers return to their multi-neighborhood feed with pills), Fix Look Ahead repeating same venue across multiple days (NO REPETITION rule in both Grok and Gemini prompts - each day must feature different events, skip days rather than pad with repeats), Add structured event listing to Look Ahead articles (Grok returns EVENTS_JSON alongside prose, TypeScript formatEventListing() groups by date with dedup for recurring events and address cleaning, compact "At a glance" rendering in ArticleBody EventListingBlock and LookAheadCard with grey bullets and middot separators, suppressed duplicate CTAs on editorial article pages), Fix nuisance watch date precision and images (date range ends yesterday with "from and including X through and including Y" format, bullet list spacing improved, switched from AI-generated getCronImage to Unsplash selectLibraryImage), Update Look Ahead label to "today and next 7 days" and primary brief text to "Daily Brief and Look Ahead" across all 9 languages and email templates, Update Sunday Edition house ad text ("living in" instead of "native in", "Place it Now" CTA) across all 9 languages + DB, Fix Look Ahead cron to generate for combos not components (combo neighborhoods like Tribeca, Ostermalm, Hamptons now get one consolidated Look Ahead article covering all component areas matching Daily Brief pattern - switched from getActiveNeighborhoodIds + is_combo=false filter to is_active=true query, added getComboInfo component name expansion for Grok search), Fix Look Ahead API for combo neighborhoods (Ostermalm and Tribeca returned null because articles stored under component IDs like stockholm-ostermalm-core - API now queries combo_neighborhoods table to expand combo IDs), Fix Look Ahead card teaser and expanded formatting (preview strips all markdown before sentence extraction - was showing raw markdown links, teaser renders as plain muted grey text matching Daily Brief style, body preprocessed with paragraph breaks around [[Day, Date]] headers so "Today," starts on new line), Fix Daily Brief card date using browser timezone instead of neighborhood (Waiheke Island UTC+13 showed FRI FEB 20 from Stockholm UTC+1, added timezone prop to NeighborhoodBrief passed from all 4 render sites), Fix Look Ahead same-day local time generation (cron used UTC date math causing articles to appear a day early - added per-neighborhood local date computation via getLocalPublishDate(timezone), published_at set to 7 AM local, cron schedule changed from `0 17-22` to `0 0-7`, Grok receives local date instead of UTC tomorrow), Look Ahead card formatting (label changed to "Look Ahead (next 7 days)" in all 9 languages, one-sentence teaser in closed card via regex, extra mt-6 on day headers when expanded), Newsletter auto-subscribe on login and signup (auto-insert into newsletter_subscribers during both signin API and auth callback, admin client bypasses RLS, ensures all registered users get Daily Brief emails), Fix sort_order column references causing 24h neighborhood sync outage (user_neighborhood_preferences has NO sort_order column - removed from 8 files that silently failed with Supabase returning error objects on non-existent columns), Profile data caching (signin API fetches profile in parallel, login page writes to flaneur-profile localStorage, account page reads instantly on mount - no grey flash), Turnstile sitekey trim (env var had trailing newline), Fix login auth - Header SIGN IN bug + mobile login hang (Header now checks flaneur-auth localStorage FIRST for instant "Account" display then getSession in background - never clears user on null session fixing SIGN IN flash with expired JWT; login page removed flaneur-auth redirect shortcut breaking redirect loop when cookies expired; login handleSubmit rewritten to server-only POST /api/auth/signin with zero navigator.locks calls reducing mobile login from ~7-8s to ~1-2s; signin API validates Turnstile token server-side via Cloudflare siteverify; 3 files: Header.tsx, login/page.tsx, api/auth/signin/route.ts), Fix global neighborhood date stamping in briefs (Grok and Gemini enrichment now receive IANA timezone from DB - expanded country-timezone fallback map from 7 to 42 entries, Grok receives explicit local date in search query and system prompt, Gemini gets DATE CORRECTION instruction to fix day-of-week/date references to match neighborhood's local date at 7 AM delivery time; 9 files updated: brief-enricher-gemini.ts, grok.ts, 5 cron routes, neighborhoods/create, briefs/enrich-gemini, auto-fixer.ts), Fix Account page auth (removed destructive signOut auto-heal that destroyed sessions when getSession returned null, added 3s Promise.race timeout matching Header pattern, flaneur-auth localStorage fallback for userId/email detection, fixed useEffect dependency from [loading] to []), Full bidirectional neighborhood sync (DB is authoritative for logged-in users; `useNeighborhoodPreferences` fetches DB prefs on mount and on `visibilitychange` tab focus, overwrites localStorage + cookie; removals on one device propagate to others within 30s of tab focus; 30s throttle prevents excessive DB calls; Header SIGNED_IN always overwrites localStorage from DB; login page and auth callback also sync DB to local; layout inline script does cookie-to-localStorage reverse sync pre-hydration), Inline article reactions with source attribution (bookmark/heart buttons moved from below bottom ad to right-aligned on the same row as source attribution text, SourceAttribution accepts `actions` ReactNode slot, ArticleReactions rendered inline without standalone margin, non-AI articles still show reactions via fallback wrapper), Fix password reset email expiry text (said "24 hours" but Supabase OTP expiry is 1 hour - corrected to "1 hour"), Require explicit calendar dates in all AI-generated content (all prompts - Gemini enrichment, Grok briefs/news/look-ahead, Claude RSS rewrites, crime blotter - now require explicit dates alongside relative time references like "yesterday (February 19)" or "this Thursday, February 20" so articles remain clear days after publication), Crime blotter source attribution (cron now collects unique sources from Grok incident data - NY Post, @NYPDnews, Citizen, etc. - and inserts them into article_sources table; SourceAttribution shows "Synthesized from reporting by..." with named sources instead of generic "public news sources"), Expandable Look Ahead card with discovery CTAs (card below Daily Brief now expands/collapses showing full article content with day headers and "Keep Reading" links - yesterday's brief, nearby brief, take me somewhere new; compact closed state unchanged; removed redundant Look Ahead CTA from Daily Brief expanded view), Neighborhood-aware article back links (BackToFeedLink and MoreStoriesButton now link to /{city}/{neighborhood} instead of bare /feed), Move feed neighborhood IDs from URL params to SameSite=Strict cookie (neighborhoods were passed as query params creating long ugly URLs and abuse vector - now stored in cookie synced from localStorage, `feed/page.tsx` reads `cookies()` instead of `searchParams`, layout inline script syncs cookie on every page load, all navigation points updated to sync cookie before `router.push('/feed')` or `router.refresh()`, Header neighborhood links now point to `/{city}/{neighborhood}` pages, `src/lib/neighborhood-cookie.ts` utility), Fix Look Ahead date showing published_at instead of created_at (articles created evening before showed "Feb 19" while content said "Today, Friday February 20" - now uses `published_at` for look_ahead articles across CompactArticleCard, ArticleCard, and article detail page), Disable Social Calendar (Gala Watch) story generator (removed `sync-gala-watch` cron from vercel.json, archived existing articles via SQL migration, removed from email preferences), Fix Look Ahead generation for combo neighborhoods (Tribeca, Hamptons, Ostermalm never got Look Ahead articles because getActiveNeighborhoodIds() didn't expand combo IDs to component IDs - components like nyc-tribeca-core have is_active=false so were filtered out; added step 4 to expand combos and removed is_active filter from generate-look-ahead cron since the active set already determines eligibility), Image feedback tooltip text ("I like this image" / "I don't like this image"), Image thumbs up/down feedback on article pages (`image_feedback` table keyed on `image_url` for cross-article aggregation, `ImageFeedback.tsx` client component with optimistic UI + anonymous_id persistence, `GET/POST /api/image-feedback` endpoint, inline with Unsplash credit line or right-aligned below AI image disclaimer, active up=amber active down=red, score shows `+N`/`-N` when non-zero), Shareable neighborhood feeds and daily brief share button (reusable `ShareButton` component in `src/components/ui/ShareButton.tsx` with `icon` and `text` variants — icon variant in NeighborhoodBrief eyebrow row, text variant in NeighborhoodHeader control deck alongside Guide/Map/History and in mobile overflow menu, also in MultiFeed masthead when a pill is active; uses `navigator.share()` with `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` fallback, `stopPropagation` prevents brief card expand/collapse; all share URLs point to clean `/{city}/{neighborhood}` paths built via `getCitySlugFromId`/`getNeighborhoodSlugFromId`; `shareUrl` prop on NeighborhoodBrief passed from 3 render sites: `[city]/[neighborhood]/page.tsx`, `feed/page.tsx` single+multi, `MultiFeed.tsx` fetched pill brief; translations for `share.share` and `share.copied` in all 9 languages), Neighborhood-local date display (article dates now render in the neighborhood's IANA timezone instead of the browser's timezone — e.g., a Shibuya brief generated at midnight JST shows "Feb 21" regardless of reader location; `formatDate()` and `formatRelativeTime()` in `utils.ts` accept optional `timezone` param passed via `article.neighborhood?.timezone`; ArticleCard shows "7h ago · Feb 21" format for < 7 days, CompactArticleCard shows "Fri, Feb 21" in local tz, article detail page same; all 5 feed query files updated to include `timezone` in neighborhood JOIN), Per-neighborhood article read tracking in localStorage (ArticleViewTracker tracks reads per neighborhood_id with 30-day pruning), PrimaryChangeSuggestion component (suggests primary neighborhood change based on reading patterns), Escape Mode house ad (new `escape_mode` type in house_ads rotation - headline "Activate Escape Mode", body describes luxury mini-vacation, CTA button "Take me somewhere new" linking to random neighborhood's latest Daily Brief via `findDiscoveryBrief()` with `mode: 'random'`; NativeAd.tsx renders optional `ctaText` as dark button, EmailAd type extended with `ctaText?: string`, ads.ts resolves dynamic URL at email assembly time, FallbackAd.tsx resolves client-side for web; DB migration added `escape_mode` to CHECK constraint + seeded ad with weight 2), Morning Brew-inspired email improvements (footer "forwarded to you?" CTA in Footer.tsx and SundayEditionTemplate, welcome email deliverability coaching with platform-specific inbox tips in subscribe/route.ts buildMagicLinkEmail(), welcome email "Here's what to expect" 2x2 grid showing Daily Brief/Look Ahead/Sunday Edition/Family Corner/Escape Mode, inline referral CTA after primary stories in DailyBriefTemplate and before footer in SundayEditionTemplate when referralUrl exists, share links on lead story in StoryList.tsx with Twitter intent + Facebook sharer URLs for isPrimary && i === 0, improved email divider hierarchy - primary story dividers #d5d5d5, full-width #999999 divider between primary and satellite sections, satellite section dividers full-width #e0e0e0, light #e5e5e5 dividers between satellite stories), Hide test neighborhoods from non-admin users (API filters `region != 'test'` for non-admins in `/api/neighborhoods/route.ts`, client-side cleanup of stale selected IDs in `NeighborhoodSelectorModal.tsx`, DB migration removed test neighborhood prefs for non-admin users), Update Unsplash cron to every 4h (production API approved at 5000/hr, changed `refresh-image-library` from `5 * * * *` to `0 */4 * * *`), Family Corner quality fixes (strip Grok citation URLs from body text via 4-pattern regex in generate-childcare-content.ts, add Gemini Flash enrichment step after Grok for polished per-age-band content using direct 35-year-old parent persona ("you/your" voice, not insiderPersona()), improve Grok prompt to require dedicated content per age group and restrict to 3-day window (today + next 2 days), show neighborhood name in email header "FAMILY CORNER · TRIBECA" with "For your primary neighborhood" note, neighborhoodName field added to FamilyCornerSection type and passed from assembler, FamilyCornerSection.tsx parses **BandLabel:** markdown into separate paragraphs with bold headers instead of rendering as one wall of text), Fix feed ordering stability (added `created_at DESC` as secondary sort in feed/page.tsx, MultiFeed.tsx, MultiLoadMoreButton.tsx, LoadMoreButton.tsx — Look Ahead articles all share the same `published_at` timestamp causing unstable ordering; `published_at DESC, created_at DESC` ensures deterministic results), Fix Look Ahead date display (hide date in CompactArticleCard for `look_ahead` articles — showing "Fri, Feb 20" on a Thursday was confusing; the "Look Ahead" category label already conveys forward-looking nature), Fix Unsplash AI badge in CompactArticleCard (added `!article.image_url.includes('unsplash.com')` guard matching ArticleCard.tsx — compact/list view was showing AI badge on real Unsplash photos), Fix Look Ahead "Good morning" greeting bug (FORMATTING RULES in brief-enricher-gemini.ts unconditionally required morning greeting for ALL article types, overriding lookAheadStyle's "NO greeting" — made greeting conditional: only daily_brief gets "Good morning", look_ahead and weekly_recap get "Do NOT include any greeting"), Family Corner preferences UX polish (changed "Save Children" button to "Save Children Changes", post-save shows green "Children changes saved" confirmation replacing the button, age band preview shows immediately when children are entered instead of only after save), Family Corner house ad promotion (new `family_corner` house ad type in DB with weight 5, FallbackAd.tsx renders with dismiss X button, suppressed when `flaneur-family-corner-enabled` localStorage is set or after 3 dismissals via `flaneur-family-corner-ad-dismissed` counter, excluded from email house ads via `.neq('type', 'family_corner')` in ads.ts, translated to 9 languages), Family Corner UX polish (prominent styled-box toggle confirmation instead of tiny green text, age band preview after saving children showing content categories per band, description text includes "tailored to your children's ages"), Family Corner UX improvements (separate Email Preferences link on Account page, #family-corner hash scroll+highlight when navigating from Account, guidance when enabled but no children entered, "Paused" instead of "Disabled" when children details saved, updated description text on both pages), Fix missing blurbs on Look Ahead articles in compact feed view (CompactArticleCard now falls back to body_text when preview_text is empty — all Look Ahead articles had empty preview_text causing blurb-less cards that buried NYC daily briefs below 22 Look Ahead cards in All Stories view; also backfilled preview_text for 22 today's Look Ahead articles from body_text via SQL), Fix multi-neighborhood feed showing only 10 articles (dynamic feedLimit scales with neighborhood count: min(n*3, 60) instead of fixed 10, prevents briefs from most neighborhoods being cut off; also fixed "Your curated feed from 0 locations" flash during page transitions by passing undefined instead of 0 to NeighborhoodHeader), Persona switcher now hides Admin/Dashboard nav links (added data-admin attribute to Header nav links so PersonaSwitcher CSS targeting [data-admin] actually works in subscriber view), Add timezone delivery hints (neighborhood selector modal and account page explain timezone sets email delivery time at 7 am local and doesn't affect neighborhood selection), Family Corner discoverable from account page (shows enabled/off status, description, link to preferences page with user's unsubscribe token), Family Corner immediate content generation (fire-and-forget triggers generate-childcare-content cron when user saves children, warm thank-you message sets expectations about next Daily Brief), Family Corner opt-in childcare section in Daily Brief (age-band-aware family content for opted-in users - user_children table stores birth month/year, childcare_content caches Grok-generated content once per neighborhood+age-band combo per day at 4 AM UTC, FamilyCornerSection email component after satellites, preferences API/UI for enable/disable + 1-4 children with month/year dropdowns, zero cost for non-opted users via early childcare_mode_enabled check in assembler.ts, 4 age bands auto-calculated: infant 0-18mo / toddler 19mo-5yr / school_age 5-12yr / teen 13-18yr, 3-day content window: "Today" + "Next 2 Days" per age group, 35yo parent persona writes as "you/your" not "our/residents"), Smarter Google verify link for globally syndicated stories (SourceAttribution buildSearchQuery omits neighborhood for Auction Watch/Gala/Overture/Museum/Route Alert category labels), Require local language greetings/sign-offs/phrases in briefs (changed from optional 'you may sprinkle' to mandatory 'ALWAYS include' in brief-enricher-gemini.ts - Daily Brief greeting must be in local language e.g. 'God morgon, grannar.' for Stockholm, sign-off in local language, 1-2 local terms woven through body), Fix Load More button loading all neighborhoods when pill filter active (MultiLoadMoreButton was outside MultiFeed so it ignored activeFilter state - moved inside as loadMoreAll prop that only renders when no pill is selected), Remove duplicate inline persona constants from 6 crons (archive-hunter, fashion-week, political-wallet, route-alert, residency-radar, nimby-alert had stale SYSTEM_PROMPT constants passed as `systemInstruction` that lacked banned outsider phrases - removed so only shared `insiderPersona()` from `ai-persona.ts` is used in user prompt), Ban outsider phrases in `insiderPersona()` in `ai-persona.ts` ("for those in the know", "the elite", "Manhattan's elite", "if you know you know", "the usual suspects", "movers and shakers"), Fix gala-watch Gemini prompt to use actual event dates (was saying "tonight" regardless of when event occurs) and matter-of-fact tone, Unify AI writing persona across all prompts (Claude Sonnet 6 cron prompts + Gemini Flash/Pro 30+ lib files use shared `insiderPersona()` from `src/lib/ai-persona.ts` for consistent "35-year-old resident" voice; Grok reverted to neutral fact-gatherer identity since persona restrictions limited fact coverage and Gemini enrichment applies voice downstream), Fix combo neighborhood feed queries (feed page and MultiFeed pill filter didn't expand combo IDs to include component neighborhoods - e.g., selecting `nyc-tribeca` missed articles under `nyc-fidi` or `nyc-tribeca-core`; article detail page now shows parent combo name in breadcrumb for component neighborhood articles), Fix generate-brief-articles broken SELECT (used `ai_model` but DB column is `model` — fixed to `brief.model`), Fix assembler fallback article creation (when generate-brief-articles hasn't run, `fetchBriefAsStory()` in assembler.ts creates brief_summary articles — was missing source extraction/insertion, enriched_at/enrichment_model, and had hardcoded ai_model instead of using brief's actual model), Suppress "verify here" on editorial content (SourceAttribution now accepts `category` prop — brief_summary/look_ahead/weekly_recap articles skip single-source verification since they're AI-generated editorial), Add sanitizeMarkdownLinks() to hyperlink-injector.ts (fixes Gemini URLs containing literal parentheses like `(PACT)` or `(NYC)` that break markdown link parsing — called in brief-enricher-gemini.ts), Expand health monitor to 9 checks (added Check 8: Editorial Sources — detects brief_summary/look_ahead/weekly_recap articles with sources, auto-fixes by deleting inappropriate source rows; Check 9: URL-Encoded Text — detects `%20`/`%2C`/etc. in article bodies, auto-fixes via decodeURIComponent; both wired into auto-fixer.ts and monitor-and-fix/route.ts), Fix Look Ahead cron logging (added `articles_created` to cron_executions INSERT in generate-look-ahead/route.ts), Redesign weather story in Daily Brief email (render non-alert stories as subtle grey 13px text inline with temperature hero block instead of bold standalone card, each sentence on its own line to prevent word-wrap, "% prob" instead of bare "%", alerts priority 1 still render as red-bordered WeatherStoryCard, replaced "Commute" with "Travel" in all weather story labels, restored Google weather search link on temperature), Fix 11 broken article-generating crons (Group A: relax political-wallet thresholds — lookback 7→30d, trigger $10K→$2.5K, donor $1K→$500; fix heritage-filings lookback 24h→336h + add `nyc-` prefix to neighborhood IDs. Group B: replace 9 broken data fetchers with `grokEventSearch()` — overture-alert and museum-watch TODO stubs implemented, sample-sale/gala-watch/route-alert/residency-radar/archive-hunter broken HTML scrapers replaced, nyc-auctions/global-auctions fake API endpoints replaced. All use shared `grokEventSearch()` in `grok.ts` with `web_search` + `x_search` tools. Each call batches all items into 1-2 prompts (not per-item) to stay under 300s timeout. Existing Gemini story generation and Blue Chip/brand/venue validation filters untouched), Rewrite liquor license cron with public NY State datasets (old `wg8y-fzsj` required auth — switched to pending `f8i8-k2gm` + active `9s3h-dpkz`, generates "Last Call" articles via Gemini Flash, parallelized batches of 5, placeholder image for timeout safety, `nyc-` prefix fix for neighborhood IDs), Fix nuisance watch empty locations (NYC 311 complaints with empty `street_name` and non-numeric `incident_address` produced empty `displayLocation` causing headlines like "Noise complaints spike on " - `anonymizeAddress()` now has 3-layer fallback: `street_name` -> extract street from `incident_address` -> cross streets, plus `titleCase()` for ALL CAPS 311 data and "0 Block of..." suppression, `clusterComplaints()` skips unresolvable locations, 6 broken articles unpublished), Government source attribution for NYC open data crons (SourceAttribution parses `editor_notes` for `Source: Name - URL` pattern, shows direct government database link instead of Google verify for nuisance watch/filming permits/alfresco permits/retail watch/NIMBY alerts, 93 existing articles backfilled), Community neighborhood premium UX (executive status application when 2-credit limit reached, self-delete within 24h with 0 followers, community reporting, luxury 'Initializing Coverage Protocol' empty state for new community neighborhoods), Fix Daily Brief writing quality (Phase 2 of enrich-briefs was re-enriching brief_summary articles with weekly_recap style stripping the "Good morning" greeting - now skips brief_summary and look_ahead articles, Pro always used for briefs / Flash for RSS articles, reinforced greeting as CRITICAL formatting rule, added neighborhood+date dedup in generate-brief-articles, fixed hardcoded enrichment_model, admin-only model label on article pages), Replace AI-generated images with Unsplash stock photos (real neighborhood photos instead of hallucinated Imagen 4 scenes, $0/quarter vs ~$90/quarter, Unsplash CDN hotlinking per their terms, photographer attribution on article pages, hourly cron backfill at 50/hr demo rate limit pending production API approval for 5000/hr), Force "Flaneur News" sender name (EMAIL_FROM env var had "Flaneur" display name which bypassed regex - now extracts email address and always wraps with "Flaneur News"), Improve Daily Brief subject teaser (use full lead headline + "& more" instead of boring 2-4 word fragments), Add "+" to preview text when multiple neighborhoods ("Your morning brief from Tribeca+"), Add teaser subject lines for Daily Brief ("Daily Brief: {Neighborhood}. {lead headline} & more") and Sunday Edition ("Sunday Edition: {Neighborhood}. {teaser}") under 70 characters, Fix Supabase security advisor issues (enable RLS on article_sources, set search_path on 10 functions, tighten legacy table INSERT policies, add community_creation_rejections policy), Add border/frame to house ad in Daily Brief and Sunday Edition emails (NativeAd.tsx gets 1px solid border with 4px radius replacing Hr dividers; SundayEditionTemplate sponsor section same treatment), Move house ad to after all primary stories in Daily Brief (was between story 1 and 2), Rename email category labels ("Daily Brief" to "Daily Brief (Today)", "Look Ahead" to "Look Ahead (next 7 days)" via cleanCategoryLabel in assembler.ts), Remove CSS line-clamp from email preview text (was causing Gmail to render "..." dots instead of story content; now relies solely on truncateAtSentence(160) for clean sentence-boundary truncation), Add satellite neighborhood preview text blurbs in email (SatelliteSection.tsx was only rendering headlines with no preview text; now shows 160-char sentence-truncated blurbs matching primary neighborhood style), Add "(next 7 days)" to Look Ahead link text (updated in BriefDiscoveryFooter, NeighborhoodBrief, DailyBriefTemplate, SundayEditionTemplate), Fix Look Ahead headline format (cron was generating "{Name} LOOK AHEAD: {headline}" causing redundant neighborhood name on article pages; changed to "LOOK AHEAD: {headline}", updated 12 existing headlines in DB), Fix image library generator count bug (generateNeighborhoodLibrary was adding partial generation count to previous season's count via images_generated, inflating to 8 even when rate-limited mid-run; now uses only current run's count for full refreshes, fixed DB counts for 3 affected neighborhoods), Fix Look Ahead "Keep reading" links (added look_ahead variant to BriefDiscoveryFooter showing "Read today's Daily Brief", hides self-referential Look Ahead link, fixed "Add to neighborhoods" showing for already-subscribed neighborhoods by using article.neighborhood_id from DB instead of buildNeighborhoodId), Strip redundant LOOK AHEAD/DAILY BRIEF prefix from headlines in email and feed (cleanHeadline in assembler.ts and cleanArticleHeadline in utils.ts), Fix Look Ahead coverage (was only processing 12/257 neighborhoods per day - cron ran once at 8 PM UTC and hit 270s time budget; changed to hourly 5-10 PM UTC with dedup + concurrency 3->5, all 257 now covered), Fix broken library image URLs (selectLibraryImage was returning URLs for non-existent files since only 9/257 neighborhoods had generated libraries; added getLibraryReadyIds() check to all 6 article-creating crons, returns empty string for neighborhoods without libraries so retry-missing-images fills them), Pre-generated neighborhood image library (8 images per neighborhood via Gemini Pro creative director + Imagen 4 generation, rotated by article type and day-of-year, eliminates per-article Gemini Image calls reducing cost from ~$750/mo to ~$30/mo, admin batch generation endpoint, automated every-4h generation cron with Imagen 4 70 RPD quota awareness, manual upload script with Gemini watermark removal + sharp resize to 1280x720, status dashboard sorted by subscriber priority, library-first fallback in generate-image endpoint, DB status tracking table, community neighborhoods generate library on creation), Look Ahead article feature (daily forward-looking articles covering tomorrow + next 7 days - hourly cron 5-10 PM UTC for 7 AM local delivery next morning: Grok search -> Gemini Flash enrichment -> article creation, neighborhoods prioritized by delivery urgency so APAC/East processed first, prompts frame content from reader's next-morning perspective, only for neighborhoods with active subscribers, LookAheadCard below daily brief in feed, Look Ahead CTAs in expanded briefs and BriefDiscoveryFooter, links in daily brief and Sunday Edition emails, active-neighborhoods.ts resolver, translations for all 9 languages), Continuity context for Gemini enrichment (feeds last 5 days of enriched briefs + last 3 days of articles into prompt so Gemini can reference prior coverage naturally - "as we noted Tuesday..."), Google Search verification link for single-source articles (SourceAttribution shows "verify on Google" link when sources <= 1, searches headline + neighborhood name), Day-of-week in feed date metadata (compact/gallery/brief cards show "Mon Feb 17" instead of "Feb 17", auto-translated via Intl.DateTimeFormat locale), "Front door" homepage experience (new visitors see full cinematic hero + "Read Stories" CTA instead of auto-redirect, returning users still instant-redirect via layout script, /discover accessible via footer logo + ContextSwitcher "The Front Door" link), Fix sticky pills syncing with header hide/show (--header-offset CSS variable, back-to-top moved to bottom-right on all screens), Fix health check brief coverage false positives (was using UTC midnight as "today" but cron uses per-timezone local dates with 36h lookback - APAC briefs generated before UTC midnight were falsely missing; also skips neighborhoods whose morning window hasn't passed yet), 3x brief generation throughput (sequential -> concurrency 3 Grok calls, was only generating ~9 briefs per run), 6x translation throughput (was only translating 26% of articles - concurrency 3->8, schedule */30->*/15, removed 30-per-language cap, Phase 1 budget 60%->75%), Fix translation stale state bug (switching languages left old translation on screen when new one didn't exist - now clears state before fetch in all 4 translation-fetching components: CompactArticleCard, ArticleCard, TranslatedArticleBody, NeighborhoodBrief), Fix email primary neighborhood mismatch (added primary_neighborhood_id to profiles table - scheduler was using ambiguous city-matching which picked wrong neighborhood when user had multiple in same city, now stores exact ID via sync-primary endpoint with city-based fallback), Fix forgot password flow (PKCE code exchange on reset-password page, send reset email via Resend instead of Supabase for inbox deliverability, fix Supabase Site URL from localhost to readflaneur.com), Pro-first Flash-fallback enrichment strategy (uses gemini-2.5-pro for first 900 requests/day then cascades to gemini-2.5-flash, preserves Pro quality for majority of briefs while staying within 1K RPD limit), Daily content health monitor cron (7 automated checks at 10 AM UTC - brief coverage, content quality, hyperlinks, HTML artifacts, translation coverage, email delivery, story images - creates cron_issues for auto-fixable problems and emails admin summary report), Fix Daily Brief card hyperlink stripping (negative lookbehind regex preserves markdown links in NeighborhoodBrief cleanContent), Strengthen link_candidates in Gemini enrichment (mandatory for all content types including weekly recaps), Add time budget to sync-neighborhood-briefs (270s of 300s maxDuration prevents silent kills with no logging), Sunday Edition concurrency + parallelization (3x concurrent neighborhoods in cron route + parallel Horizon/DataPoint/Holiday sections in generateWeeklyBrief for 2-3x faster generation), Sunday Edition Sunday-context enrichment (weeklyRecapStyle explicitly states "write as if it is Sunday" even when processed later), Move sign-out to /account page for infinite session pattern, Add retry-missing-images cron to fill failed article images, Filter empty image_url strings in feed image fallback, Fix Header auth persistence (getSession() deadlock via navigator.locks from GoTrue _initialize(), 3s timeout + onAuthStateChange only handles positive events, router.push client-side nav after login, removed getUser() from middleware that was clearing cookies, loading guard prevents SIGN IN flash), Fix Sunday Edition not sending (Daily Brief skips Sundays so it doesn't block Sunday Edition dedup, sync-weekly-brief batch increased from 10 to 500 to cover all 270 neighborhoods), Fix login/auth split-brain state (login redirects authenticated users to /feed, account page auto-heals stale localStorage tokens, sign-out clears both client+server state, GoTrue REST API bypass for broken CAPTCHA), Translate house ad text (headlines, body, CTAs) into 9 languages with type-specific CTA buttons and {neighborhoodCount} placeholder handling, Translate all 5 footer pages (about, legal, standards, contact, careers) into 9 languages with server/client splits for metadata + translation sync checker script, Preserve markdown links in Gemini enrichment pipeline (was stripping [text](url) before saving to DB so render-time fix had nothing to work with), Change share title to "Check out Flaneur" (was "Join me on Flaneur" which Outlook rendered as "Url from [name]"), Reduce header spacing between Stories and theme/language icons, Fix inviter detection on /invite (check auth session + localStorage neighborhoods, not just newsletter-subscribed flag), Restore hyperlinks in daily briefs and article bodies (HTML tags converted to markdown, markdown links rendered as clickable <a> elements instead of stripped), Rename "All Stories" to "All My Neighborhood Stories" on article pages (all 9 languages), Add spacing between neighborhood name and Edit Neighborhoods link on feed, Dual-mode invite page (subscribed users see share UX with copy link + native share + referral stats; invitees see join form unchanged) + fix subscribe CAPTCHA bypass (admin generateLink + Resend instead of signInWithOtp), Streamline invite page (remove manual neighborhood selection, auto-detect location on subscribe, "Join" instead of "Subscribe", dynamic house ad neighborhood count), Fix "Read yesterday's Daily Brief" to use date-relative queries (beforeDate instead of excludeSlug, ensures yesterday is relative to the brief being viewed), Change "Daily Brief for your primary" to "Above is the Daily Brief for your primary" in all 9 languages, Fix translate-content cron starvation (LIMIT 20 only translated newest 20 items, never reaching 800+; now uses 4-step ID-first approach) + fix broken cron logging (wrong column names caused 0 logged runs), DB cleanup of corrupted articles (7 specialized articles with Gemini refusal bodies deleted, 107 unprotected articles retroactively given enriched_at), Systemic enriched_at fix across all 27 article-creating crons (prevents enrich-briefs Phase 2 from overwriting specialized article bodies with daily brief content), Fix nuisance watch articles overwritten by enrich-briefs (set enriched_at at creation), Mobile feed vertical space fix (hide MagicLinkReminder on mobile, tighten daily brief spacing), Headline truncation dangling preposition strip (for/in/at/on/to/of/by/with/from/into/as/the/a/an/and/or/but), Translation completeness sweep (wire remaining UI strings through t(), translate Daily Brief category labels, article page brief headline via TranslatedHeadline, cron language rotation for fair zh/ja coverage), Daily brief discovery system (yesterday's brief + nearby + "take me somewhere new" CTAs on expanded briefs and brief article pages, unified "Keep reading" footer with integrated email capture), Compact article reactions (bookmark/heart only, no fire, inline), Gallery story separators, House ad single-line headlines, Article body Grok leak stripping, Daily brief primary neighborhood context in all-stories view, Shift brief generation window to midnight-7 AM (was 3-9 AM) for reliable email delivery, Render markdown hyperlinks in article body and brief content as clickable links (HTML tags converted to markdown format, stripped raw URLs and citation markers), Mobile gallery single-line headlines (no wrap, truncated at last full word) + wider story spacing (space-y-14), Editorial photo image style (watercolor → photorealistic fashion photography of iconic locations), Per-neighborhood default fallback images (stored in storage, checked before article fallback), Gallery mobile layout (headline-first, truncated metadata, 4-line blurb), Tighten headline generation prompts (80 chars → 50 chars across sync-news/Grok briefs/Grok stories), Fix mobile dropdown "All Stories" light mode contrast (text-white to text-fg), Block AI scrapers via robots.txt (21 bots), Wire translations into remaining components (EmailCaptureCard, MagicLinkReminder, MultiFeed "My Neighborhoods", ArticleCard gallery headlines), Remove auto-linking from articles and briefs (render-time entity detection + pipeline hyperlink injection disabled), Mobile headline truncation (40-char word-boundary truncation, strip dangling prepositions/articles/conjunctions/St.), Strip DAILY BRIEF prefix from feed headlines + mobile brief headline wrap, Add Portuguese/Italian/Simplified Chinese (9 languages), Language toggle globe icon + mobile fix, Stripe webhook secret trim fix, Mobile feed card layouts (compact: metadata+headline above image on mobile, gallery: metadata+headline above image with 2-line wrap, gallery spacing), Language translation system (batch pre-translation via Gemini Flash cron, 9 languages, LanguageToggle UI, translated articles/briefs/UI chrome), Search page UX (close button, rounded corners, luxury styling), Feed empty state CTA (Choose Neighborhoods button opens modal), Theme accent fix (theme-aware accent color, hamburger chip contrast, scroll-close threshold), Full light/dark theme system (CSS variables, useTheme hook, ThemeToggle, semantic Tailwind classes, flash prevention, force-dark hero), Mobile ViewToggle moved above feed (not in dropdown row), Fix generate-brief-articles cron (batch=10 starved 260+ neighborhoods, now processes all in one pass with 36h window), mobile dropdown "Explore" link + empty search -> Community Created tab, rename Community -> Community Created in selector, Mobile neighborhood dropdown (replaces pill scroll on mobile, full list in one tap), Signup page polish (remove role picker, rounded corners, default reader), enrichment-gated brief publishing (email + article cron skip unenriched briefs), custom SMTP via Resend for auth emails, Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA on signup/login, standards page restyle, mobile view toggle consolidation, Mobile UX overhaul (navigation wayfinding, feed layout, selector fixes, auth flow, ad grace period), Community neighborhoods (user-created neighborhoods with AI validation + full brief pipeline), "Create Your Own Neighborhood" house ad, community neighborhoods TypeScript fixes (openModal signature, GlobalRegion exhaustiveness), global 5-email-per-day limit, always-resend on primary neighborhood change, Vercel preview build fix (lazy-init Supabase admin in 6 routes), Hamptons component renames (removed redundant suffix), brief content sanitization fixes (nested-paren URLs, URL-encoded artifacts), neighborhood selector tidy (renames, region consolidation, new neighborhoods), single-line feed headlines, enrichment language/framing fixes, brighter brief section headings, "Suggest a Neighborhood" house ad + contact form + admin page, dynamic house ads ("Check Out a New Neighborhood" with discovery brief links), Add to Collection CTA on article pages, bare /feed redirect, Grok search result sanitization, Sunday Edition holidays expanded (19 → 50 across 20 countries), tracked referral system, primary neighborhood sync, Gemini model switch (2.5-pro), feed article dedup, engagement-triggered email capture, smart auto-redirect.

### Email Capture (Engagement-Triggered)
- **Trigger:** `flaneur-article-reads` localStorage counter incremented in `ArticleViewTracker`. Threshold: 3 reads.
- **Placement 1 - Feed inline:** `EmailCaptureCard` injected after 5th article via `injectEmailPrompt()` in `ad-engine.ts`. "Get {neighborhood} stories in your inbox" + email input. Dismiss stores `flaneur-email-prompt-dismissed`.
- **Placement 2 - Article page:** `PostReadEmailCapture` after `ArticleReactions`. Compact inline: "Enjoying {neighborhood} stories? Get them daily."
- **Placement 3 - Return visit:** `ReturnVisitPrompt` in global layout. `flaneur-session-count` incremented once per session (sessionStorage guard). Shows slide-up toast on 2nd+ session with 3+ reads. Auto-dismisses after 10s unless interacted.
- **All prompts:** Hidden when `flaneur-newsletter-subscribed` = `'true'` or `flaneur-email-prompt-dismissed` = `'true'`. Posts to `/api/newsletter/subscribe` with neighborhoodIds from localStorage.
- **New localStorage keys:** `flaneur-article-reads` (number), `flaneur-email-prompt-dismissed` ('true'), `flaneur-session-count` (number)

### Homepage "Front Door" Experience
- **New visitors:** Full cinematic hero animation plays (logo → tagline → stats → rule → "Read Stories" button). No auto-redirect. User clicks "READ STORIES" to enter.
- **"Read Stories" button:** `HomepageEnterButton` (`src/components/home/HomepageEnterButton.tsx`) - client component, calls `/api/location/detect-and-match` (5s timeout), saves neighborhoods to localStorage + syncs cookie, `router.push('/feed?welcome={city}')`. Graceful fallback to `/feed` on failure. Uses `btn-secondary` styling, `hero-fade-in-delay-4` (1.2s delay).
- **Returning users:** Inline `<script>` in `layout.tsx` syncs localStorage to `flaneur-neighborhoods` cookie on every page load, then redirects from `/` to `/feed` before React hydration (no homepage flash).
- **Revisiting the front door:** Footer FLANEUR logo links to `/discover` (not `/`). ContextSwitcher has "The Front Door" link to `/discover` (house icon).
- **Discover page:** `/discover` — full homepage experience with `HomeSignupEnhanced` (neighborhood chips + "READ STORIES"), no auto-redirect
- **API:** `src/app/api/location/detect-and-match/route.ts` — uses `detectLocationFromIP()` + Haversine sort against all active non-combo neighborhoods
- **WelcomeBanner:** `src/components/feed/WelcomeBanner.tsx` — "Viewing stories near {city}. Customize" with dismiss X. Strips `welcome` param on dismiss. Stores dismissal in localStorage.
- **Translation keys:** `homepage.readStories` (9 languages), `nav.frontDoor` (9 languages)
- **SmartRedirect:** Component still exists (`src/components/home/SmartRedirect.tsx`) but no longer used on homepage. Kept for potential reuse.

### Auth (Pre-Launch)
- **OAuth hidden:** Google & Apple login buttons hidden on `/login` and `/signup` pages. Code is fully implemented and ready to re-enable (just uncomment the OAuth button sections).
- **Current auth:** Email/password only via Supabase Auth. Leaked password protection (HaveIBeenPwned) available on Pro Plan - not yet enabled.
- **OAuth callback routes:** Both `/auth/callback` and `/api/auth/callback` are intact and working
- **Turnstile CAPTCHA:** Cloudflare Turnstile on `/signup` and `/login` pages. Gracefully degrades (no widget shown) when `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` is not set. On error, widget resets automatically. Submit button disabled until token received. Dark theme, flexible size. Requires Supabase dashboard CAPTCHA config with the Turnstile secret key.
- **Newsletter subscribe:** `/api/newsletter/subscribe` uses `supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.generateLink({ type: 'magiclink' })` + Resend to send verification email. Bypasses Turnstile CAPTCHA (admin key). Does NOT use `signInWithOtp` (requires CAPTCHA token from client).
- **Custom SMTP:** Auth emails (confirmation, magic link) sent via Resend SMTP for better deliverability. Configured in Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > SMTP Settings.
- **Forgot password:** `/forgot-password` page calls `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` which uses `supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.generateLink({ type: 'recovery' })` + Resend to send branded reset email (bypasses Supabase email system entirely for better deliverability). Reset link routes through `/auth/callback?next=/reset-password` for PKCE code exchange. `/reset-password` page checks session and allows password update, redirects to `/feed` on success.
- **Signup form:** Name, email, password only. No role picker (all users default to `reader`). Rounded corners (`rounded-lg`) on all inputs/buttons matching login page.
- **Login flow:** Server-only path: POST to `/api/auth/signin` (GoTrue REST API with service role key, validates Turnstile server-side, sets cookies via Set-Cookie headers). Client writes `flaneur-auth` + GoTrue localStorage key (zero `navigator.locks` calls), then `window.location.href = '/feed'`. No `signInWithPassword`, no `setSession`. Mobile login: ~1-2s.
- **Login page session check:** Only checks `getSession()` (2s timeout). Does NOT check flaneur-auth (creates redirect loop when cookies expired). If getSession returns null, clears stale flaneur-auth and shows login form.
- **Header auth:** Checks `flaneur-auth` localStorage FIRST (instant, no locks) to show "Account" immediately. Then `getSession()` in background (3s timeout) to upgrade to full User object. Never clears user if getSession returns null (expired JWT is gracefully degraded). `onAuthStateChange` only handles positive session events. Sign-out via full page reload from `/account`.
- **Turnstile server-side:** `/api/auth/signin` validates captcha token via Cloudflare `siteverify` API using `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` env var. Gracefully degrades if Cloudflare unreachable.
- **Middleware:** `getSession()` only (no `getUser()`). `getUser()` was removed because it makes a network call that can hang, and if it returns 401, GoTrue internally clears session cookies via the response's `setAll` callback.
- **Newsletter auto-subscribe:** Both login (`/api/auth/signin`) and signup (`/auth/callback`) auto-insert user into `newsletter_subscribers` table if not already subscribed. Uses admin client (service role), sets `email_verified: true`. Ensures all registered users receive Daily Brief emails.
- **Profile caching:** Signin API fetches profile data (timezone, childcare_mode, prefsToken) in parallel with prefs/newsletter. Login page writes to `flaneur-profile` localStorage. Account page reads cached profile on mount for instant rendering.
- **Sign-out:** `/account` page calls `signOut()` + `POST /api/auth/signout` + `window.location.href = '/'` (full reload clears all state).

### Language Translation (Batch Pre-Translation)
- **Approach:** Batch pre-translate articles and briefs via Gemini Flash cron. UI strings via client-side dictionary.
- **Languages:** English (default), Swedish (sv), French (fr), German (de), Spanish (es), Portuguese (pt), Italian (it), Simplified Chinese (zh), Japanese (ja)
- **DB tables:** `article_translations` (article_id, language_code, headline, body, preview_text), `brief_translations` (brief_id, language_code, content, enriched_content). RLS: public read, service_role write.
- **Hook:** `useLanguage()` (`src/hooks/useLanguage.ts`) - language state, browser detection via `navigator.languages`, localStorage `flaneur-language`
- **Provider:** `LanguageProvider` (`src/components/providers/LanguageProvider.tsx`) - React context wrapping useLanguage, added to layout.tsx
- **UI strings:** `src/lib/translations.ts` - ~290 keys per language, `t(key, language)` lookup with English fallback. `useTranslation()` hook wraps context + t().
- **Toggle:** `LanguageToggle` (`src/components/layout/LanguageToggle.tsx`) - greyscale wireframe globe icon. OFF: click auto-detects browser language; if English, opens picker dropdown so user can choose. ON: globe + amber badge ("SV"), click globe = back to English, click badge = picker dropdown.
- **Cron:** `translate-content` (*/15, maxDuration=300, 250s budget). Translates articles/briefs from last 48h. Concurrency 8, exponential backoff on 429. Phase split: 75% articles, 25% briefs. No per-language cap. **Language rotation:** Rotates start language each run (based on quarter-hour offset) so all 8 languages get fair coverage. Logs to `cron_executions`.
- **API:** `GET /api/translations/article?id=...&lang=...`, `GET /api/translations/brief?id=...&lang=...` - 1h cache headers, returns translation or 404.
- **Content integration:** `TranslatedArticleBody` + `TranslatedHeadline` (article pages), `CompactArticleCard` (feed headlines/previews), `NeighborhoodBrief` (brief content) - all fetch translations client-side, fall back to English.
- **UI chrome:** `t()` wired into Header, Footer, MultiFeed, FeedList, BackToTopButton, NeighborhoodHeader, ContextSwitcher, WelcomeBanner, NeighborhoodBrief, search page, About, Legal, Standards, Contact, Careers pages
- **Flash prevention:** Inline script in layout.tsx sets `document.documentElement.lang` from `flaneur-language` localStorage
- **NOT translated:** Email templates (stay English), admin pages, neighborhood/city names (proper nouns), paid ad content (advertiser-supplied), advertise booking page. House ads ARE translated via `houseAd.{type}.headline/body/cta` keys.
- **Translation sync check:** `node scripts/check-translations.mjs` - verifies all languages have the same keys as English. Run after editing English strings.
- **Footer pages:** About (server/client split for Supabase data), Legal (privacy + terms tabs), Standards (server/client for metadata), Contact, Careers (server/client for metadata) - all fully translated via `t()` keys
- **localStorage key:** `flaneur-language` (ISO 639-1 code, absence = English)
- **Translation service:** `src/lib/translation-service.ts` - Gemini Flash wrapper with retry, preserves local language terms and proper nouns

### Enrichment-Gated Brief Publishing
- **Rule:** Brief articles are NEVER created from unenriched (raw Grok) content. Only `enriched_content` from Gemini is used.
- **Email assembler** (`assembler.ts`): `fetchBriefAsStory()` returns `null` if the brief has no `enriched_content`, skipping the brief link in the email rather than linking to sparse content. **Fallback path:** When generate-brief-articles hasn't created an article yet, assembler creates brief_summary articles directly — uses brief's actual `model` value (not hardcoded), sets `enriched_at`/`enrichment_model`, and extracts+inserts sources from `enriched_categories`.
- **Brief article cron** (`generate-brief-articles`): Already filters `.not('enriched_content', 'is', null)`, and no longer has a raw content fallback. Neighborhood+date dedup keeps only the latest brief per neighborhood per day (prevents duplicate articles from concurrent deployments). Uses actual `model` from brief (DB column is `model`, NOT `ai_model`). Uses `enrichment_model` from brief for enrichment tracking.
- **Effect:** If enrichment hasn't run yet when the email sends, the email will include regular articles but skip the brief link. The brief article gets created on the next cron cycle after enrichment completes.

### Look Ahead Articles (Forward-Looking Events)
- **Cron:** `generate-look-ahead` (`0 0-7 * * *`, maxDuration=300, 270s budget) - runs hourly midnight-7 AM UTC (8 runs), publishes for 7 AM local same day. Per-neighborhood local date computation via `getLocalPublishDate(timezone)`: `toLocaleDateString('en-CA', { timeZone })` for YYYY-MM-DD, `published_at` set to 7 AM local converted to UTC. Grok receives local date (not UTC tomorrow). Dedup uses per-neighborhood local dates.
- **Priority:** Neighborhoods sorted by delivery urgency - those whose 7 AM local comes soonest (APAC/East) are processed first
- **Scope:** Fetches `is_active=true` neighborhoods (same as Daily Brief cron - combos are `is_active=true`, components are `is_active=false` so naturally excluded). Filtered to only neighborhoods with active subscribers via `getActiveNeighborhoodIds()`. For combo neighborhoods, `getComboInfo()` expands to component names for Grok search (e.g., "FiDi, Tribeca Core, Lower East Side"). Article stored under combo ID.
- **Grok function:** `generateLookAhead()` in `grok.ts` - forward-looking search framed as "tomorrow morning" (since cron runs evening before). Explicit date context so Grok knows publication date. Returns `LookAheadResult` extending `NeighborhoodBrief` with `structuredEvents: StructuredEvent[]` parsed from `EVENTS_JSON:` section in Grok response.
- **Structured event listing:** `src/lib/look-ahead-events.ts` - `StructuredEvent` interface (date, day_label, time, name, category, location, address, price), `formatEventListing()` groups by date, deduplicates recurring events with "(also on Sun, Mon)" suffix, strips postcodes/city from addresses via `cleanAddress()`, sorts chronologically. Output format: `[[Event Listing]]\n\n[[Today, Sat Feb 21]]\n\nEvent name; Category, Time; Venue, Address.\n\n---`. Cron prepends formatted listing to Gemini-enriched prose body. `isEventLine()` exported for render detection (2+ semicolons). `ArticleBody.tsx` extracts `[[Event Listing]]...---` block and renders via `EventListingBlock` component (compact "At a glance" styling with grey bullets, middot separators, date headers as small uppercase). `LookAheadCard.tsx` has matching compact rendering in expanded view. Teaser extraction skips event listing, only uses prose body. Fallback: if EVENTS_JSON missing/malformed, `structuredEvents = []`, article works prose-only.
- **Tourist trap filter:** Three layers: (1) Grok prompt excludes permanent shows (Mamma Mia, Lion King, Phantom, Wicked), guided tours, food tours, food hall tours, hop-on-hop-off, segway tours, pub crawls, escape rooms, and any activity primarily marketed to tourists; (2) Gemini enrichment `lookAheadStyle` has matching filter; (3) `isTouristActivity()` in `look-ahead-events.ts` catches anything that slips through via regex on event name/category. Only include tourist attractions if something genuinely unusual is happening (closing, reopening, major cast change, anniversary milestone).
- **No repetition rule:** Both Grok prompt and Gemini `lookAheadStyle` prohibit repeating the same venue/restaurant/event across multiple day sections. If a venue is open every day, mention it once on the most relevant day. Skip days with no unique events rather than padding with repeats. Quality over quantity.
- **Banned passive language:** Both `grok.ts` (look-ahead system prompt) and `brief-enricher-gemini.ts` (`dailyBriefStyle` and `lookAheadStyle`) ban "Quiet Week/Friday/Day", "Slow", "Calm", "Winding Down", "Not Much Going On", "Nothing Major" in both headlines AND body text via ENERGY RULES. Always lead with what IS happening.
- **Enrichment:** `articleType: 'look_ahead'` in `brief-enricher-gemini.ts` - no greeting/sign-off, organized by individual day headers using `[[Day, Weekday Month Date]]` format (e.g., `[[Today, Wednesday February 18]]`, `[[Thursday, February 19]]`). Skip days with no events. Rendered as `<h3>` section headers by ArticleBody.tsx for scannability. `briefGeneratedAt` set to tomorrow 7 AM so Gemini CURRENT TIME context matches reader's perspective. Uses Flash exclusively (10K RPD, no Pro budget pressure).
- **Headline format:** `LOOK AHEAD: {headline}` (no neighborhood name prefix). `cleanArticleHeadline()` strips the `LOOK AHEAD:` prefix for feed/email display. Article page shows full "LOOK AHEAD:" headline.
- **Article:** `article_type: 'look_ahead'`, `category_label: '{Name} Look Ahead'`, deterministic slug `{id}-look-ahead-{tomorrowDate}-{headline}`, `published_at` set to tomorrow 7 AM UTC, concurrency 5
- **Dedup:** Checks for existing `look_ahead` articles for tomorrow's date per neighborhood
- **API:** `GET /api/briefs/look-ahead?neighborhoodId=xxx` - returns most recent Look Ahead article URL (last 48h). Articles now stored under combo IDs directly. API still expands combo neighborhoods via `combo_neighborhoods` table for backward compatibility with any existing component-stored articles.
- **Feed card:** `LookAheadCard` (`src/components/feed/LookAheadCard.tsx`) - self-fetching expandable card below daily brief. Compact closed state: "LOOK AHEAD (NEXT 7 DAYS)" label + one-sentence plain-text teaser (markdown stripped, muted grey, matching Daily Brief style). Expanded: body preprocessed with `\n\n` around `[[Day, Date]]` headers (same as `ArticleBody.tsx`), markdown links rendered as `<a>` tags, "Show Less" button, discovery CTAs (yesterday's Daily Brief, nearby brief, "Take me somewhere new"), and "Read the full Look Ahead article" link. API returns `bodyText`, `headline`, `previewText`, `publishedAt` alongside `url`. Wired into single-feed `page.tsx` and `MultiFeed.tsx` with `city` prop for discovery CTA `excludeCity`.
- **Discovery CTAs:** Look Ahead link in `BriefDiscoveryFooter` on article pages. Removed from `NeighborhoodBrief` expanded view (redundant since LookAheadCard itself now expands with discovery CTAs).
- **Email:** Look Ahead URL fetched in `assembler.ts` (`fetchLookAheadUrl()`), passed via `DailyBriefContent.lookAheadUrl`. Rendered in `DailyBriefTemplate` (after stories, before satellites) and `SundayEditionTemplate` (after THE NEXT FEW DAYS section). Link text: "Read the Look Ahead (next 7 days) for {name}". Both `fetchLookAheadAsStory()` and `fetchLookAheadUrl()` accept `isCombo` param — for combo neighborhoods, `expandNeighborhoodIds()` queries `combo_neighborhoods` table to include component IDs in the article lookup (fixes Tribeca, Ostermalm, Hamptons Overview missing Look Ahead articles stored under component IDs).
- **Article pages:** `BriefDiscoveryFooter` rendered with `variant="look_ahead"` on Look Ahead pages (shows "Read today's Daily Brief", hides self-referential Look Ahead link, shows add-to-neighborhoods + email capture), `variant="sunday"` on Sunday Edition pages (discovery links only), default `variant="daily"` on daily brief pages. Uses `article.neighborhood_id` from DB (not `buildNeighborhoodId()`) to avoid mismatches for non-standard country slugs.
- **Cost:** ~$0.48/day (~50-80 neighborhoods x $0.006 per Grok+Flash call)
- **Translation keys:** `feed.lookAhead`, `feed.lookAheadCta` in all 9 languages. Article body translation handled by existing `translate-content` cron.

### Mobile UX Overhaul
- **Navigation wayfinding:** Logo links to `/feed` (not `/`). "Stories" link in both desktop and mobile nav for all users. "Dashboard" gated behind admin. Default entry point changed from `/login` to `/signup`.
- **Homepage hero:** FLANEUR + tagline wrapped in `<Link href="/feed">` on both `/` (homepage) and `/discover` as manual fallback for returning users.
- **Mobile menu:** "Edit selections" renamed to "Edit Neighborhoods" with `text-amber-500/80` accent. "Stories" link appears for all users (auth + unauth). Padding tightened to `py-3`.
- **Back-to-top button:** Bottom-right FAB on mobile (`fixed bottom-6 right-4`), top-center on desktop. Text label hidden on mobile (`hidden md:inline`).
- **Masthead padding:** `pt-2 md:pt-6` (tighter on mobile, preserved on desktop).
- **Neighborhood nav (MultiFeed):** Mobile (<768px): dropdown selector (`bg-[#121212] border-white/10 rounded-lg`) showing active neighborhood name + city or "All Stories", with `max-h-[60vh]` scrollable list (amber dot for primary, checkmark for active, PRIMARY badge). Click-outside-to-close. "Explore other neighborhoods" link at bottom opens selector modal. Manage button beside dropdown; ViewToggle moved down to just above feed (`md:hidden flex justify-end`). Desktop (>=768px): unchanged pill bar with drag-to-reorder, scroll arrows, fade indicators, manage + ViewToggle in pill row. Both share `activeFilter` state.
- **Guide/Map/History:** Hidden on mobile (`hidden md:flex`), replaced with `...` overflow dropdown (`md:hidden`) containing Guide/Map/History as vertical items.
- **Daily brief styling:** `border-l-2 border-amber-500/40` on brief container to distinguish from ads.
- **Brief ordering (single view):** Brief moved from before `<NeighborhoodFeed>` to `dailyBrief` prop (renders after header, not before neighborhood name).
- **Compact card mobile layout:** On mobile (`md:hidden`), metadata + headline render full-width above image. Image sits left with blurb to its right. Desktop unchanged (single flex row).
- **Gallery card mobile layout:** On mobile, metadata + headline render above the image (not overlaid). Headline wraps to max 2 lines via `line-clamp-2`. Desktop keeps gradient overlay on image. Gallery spacing: `space-y-6` mobile, `space-y-4` desktop.
- **Metadata no-wrap:** `CompactArticleCard` metadata row gets `overflow-hidden whitespace-nowrap`. Category label strips redundant neighborhood prefix via regex, truncates at 120px.
- **Neighborhood selector:** Search input no auto-focus on mobile (desktop only via `window.innerWidth >= 768`). Attempts geolocation on open for default nearest sort. "Set as Primary" always visible on mobile (`opacity-100 md:opacity-0 md:group-hover/item:opacity-100`). "Go to Stories >" escape link in modal header.
- **Auth flow:** `emailRedirectTo: window.location.origin/auth/callback` prevents localhost redirect. "Check spam" hint on confirmation screen.
- **AI badge on feed images:** `ArticleCard.tsx` skips the AI badge when `image_url` contains `unsplash.com` since those are real photos, not AI-generated.
- **Ad grace period:** `useNewUserGracePeriod` hook (`src/hooks/useNewUserGracePeriod.ts`) checks `flaneur-first-visit` localStorage timestamp. `FeedList` filters out ads and email prompts during first 5 days.
- **New localStorage key:** `flaneur-first-visit` (timestamp, set on first visit)

### Tracked Referral System
- **Invite page:** `/invite` - dual-mode page. **Inviter mode** (existing user, no `?ref=` param): "Share Flaneur" heading, personalized invite link in readonly input, "Copy Link" + "Share" buttons (native share on mobile), referral stats (clicks/friends joined) if > 0. **Invitee mode** (new visitor or `?ref=` param): streamlined hero with email input, auto-detects location on submit, subscribes, redirects to `/feed?welcome={city}`. No `SmartRedirect` (visitors must see the page). Detection: `flaneur-newsletter-subscribed` localStorage OR `flaneur-neighborhood-preferences` localStorage OR active auth session (via `getSession()`), AND no `?ref=` param.
- **Referral link:** `/invite?ref=CODE` - hero shows "A friend invited you to" above FLANEUR. Code stored in `sessionStorage` (`flaneur-referral-code`).
- **Referral codes:** 8-char alphanumeric (no ambiguous chars), lazy-generated on first access via `generate_referral_code()` Postgres function. Unique across `profiles.referral_code` and `newsletter_subscribers.referral_code`.
- **API endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/referral/code` - get or generate code (session auth or email+token)
  - `POST /api/referral/track` - record click (fire-and-forget, IP hash dedup within 24h)
  - `POST /api/referral/convert` - record conversion (fire-and-forget, self-referral prevention)
  - `GET /api/referral/stats` - return `{ code, clicks, conversions }` for share widget
- **Conversion flow:** Subscribe on invite page -> `POST /api/newsletter/subscribe` -> `POST /api/referral/convert` (fire-and-forget). Updates existing click row to `converted` status, or creates direct conversion if no click row exists.
- **Share surfaces:**
  - Email footer: "Share Flaneur" link (between "Manage preferences" and "Unsubscribe") in Daily Brief (`Footer.tsx`) and Sunday Edition (inline footer). Only shown when recipient has a referral code.
  - ContextSwitcher: "Invite a Friend" item at bottom of dropdown (via `ShareWidget` compact mode). Only shown if `flaneur-newsletter-subscribed` is set.
  - Invite page: `/invite` shows share UX with invite link + copy/share buttons for subscribed users (inviter mode)
  - `ShareWidget` (`src/components/referral/ShareWidget.tsx`): Fetches code from `/api/referral/code`, caches in localStorage (`flaneur-referral-code`). Uses `navigator.share()` on mobile, clipboard copy on desktop.
- **Scheduler integration:** `src/lib/email/scheduler.ts` fetches `referral_code` from both `profiles` and `newsletter_subscribers`, lazy-generates if null. Passed via `EmailRecipient.referralCode` to templates.
- **Database:** `referrals` table (referral_code, referrer_type/id, referred_email/type/id, status clicked/converted, ip_hash, timestamps). RLS: service_role only. Unique index on `(referral_code, referred_email) WHERE status = 'converted'`.
- **localStorage keys:** `flaneur-referral-code` (user's own code, cached by ShareWidget)
- **sessionStorage keys:** `flaneur-referral-code` (incoming referral code from `?ref=` param, consumed on conversion)

### Suggest a Neighborhood
- **House ad:** `house_ads` where `type = 'suggest_neighborhood'`, headline "Suggest a Neighborhood", click_url `#suggest` (handled inline, not navigated)
- **Shared form:** `src/components/NeighborhoodSuggestionForm.tsx` - client component with `compact` (house ad inline) and `full` (contact page) variants. Suggestion text + optional email + submit.
- **FallbackAd integration:** `HouseAdDisplay` handles `suggest_neighborhood` type - renders "Suggest" button that toggles inline form (not a link). Both card and story_open variants.
- **Contact page:** `/contact` includes "Suggest a Neighborhood" section with full-variant form
- **API endpoint:** `POST /api/suggestions/neighborhood` - validates (3-200 chars), SHA-256 IP hash, rate limit 5/hour per IP, detects city/country from Vercel headers, inserts to `neighborhood_suggestions` table
- **Email notification:** `notifyNeighborhoodSuggestion()` in `email.ts` sends to `contact@readflaneur.com`
- **Neighborhood selector modal:** `NeighborhoodSelectorModal.tsx` "Suggest a Destination" wired to API endpoint (was direct Supabase insert that silently failed due to RLS). Optional email field added. Both placements: bottom of city list + empty search state.
- **Admin page:** `/admin/suggestions` - stats row, filter tabs (all/new/reviewed/added/dismissed), table with inline notes editing and status actions
- **Admin API:** `GET/PATCH /api/admin/suggestions` - admin role auth, service role DB access

### Community Neighborhoods (User-Created)
- **Limit:** 2 per authenticated user
- **Create endpoint:** `POST /api/neighborhoods/create` (maxDuration=300) - auth, limit check, Gemini Flash AI validation (verifies real neighborhood, normalizes name/city/country/region/timezone/coordinates), duplicate detection (exact ID + 500m Haversine proximity), insert, pipeline, instant resend
- **Pipeline:** Runs synchronously after insert with 240s time budget. Each step is try/catch (graceful degradation - crons fill gaps):
  1. Grok brief generation (`generateNeighborhoodBrief()`)
  2. Gemini enrichment (`enrichBriefWithGemini()`)
  3. Article creation (same schema as `generate-brief-articles` cron)
  4. Unsplash image library generation (`generateNeighborhoodLibrary()`)
- **Count endpoint:** `GET /api/neighborhoods/my-community-count` - returns `{ count }` for limit UI
- **DB columns:** `neighborhoods.is_community` (boolean), `neighborhoods.created_by` (UUID), `neighborhoods.community_status` ('active'|'removed')
- **Region:** All community neighborhoods use `region: 'community'`
- **ID format:** `generateCommunityId(city, name)` - deterministic slug (e.g., `paris-montmartre`)
- **Shared utilities:** `src/lib/community-pipeline.ts` - `generateCommunityId()`, `generateBriefArticleSlug()`, `generatePreviewText()`
- **Neighborhood selector:** "All Neighborhoods" | "Community" tab toggle. Community tab has create form (text input + button with validating/generating status states), count display, community neighborhood list grouped by city. "Community" badge on community neighborhoods in All tab.
- **Modal tab param:** `openModal('community')` opens directly to Community tab (used by house ad)
- **House ad:** `community_neighborhood` type in `house_ads` - "Create Your Own Neighborhood" with "Get Started" button. Opens modal to Community tab. Hidden via `flaneur-has-community-neighborhood` localStorage once user has created one.
- **Success message:** "You will receive a daily brief for {name} at 7am local time starting tomorrow."
- **Admin:** `/admin/community-neighborhoods` page + `GET/PATCH /api/admin/community-neighborhoods` - list all, remove/restore (toggles `community_status` + `is_active`)
- **Neighborhoods API:** Filters out `community_status = 'removed'` neighborhoods. Hides `region = 'test'` neighborhoods from non-admin users (admin check via session + profile role).
- **localStorage keys:** `flaneur-has-community-neighborhood` ('true' after first creation)
- **Executive status application:** When users reach 2-neighborhood limit, "apply for executive status here" link reveals inline textarea + submit. API: `POST /api/neighborhoods/apply-executive` inserts into `executive_applications` table (pending status). Duplicate prevention: one pending application per user.
- **Self-delete:** Creator can delete community neighborhood within 24h if 0 other followers. Trash icon with confirm dialog. API: `POST /api/neighborhoods/delete-community` (soft-delete: sets `community_status = 'removed'`, `is_active = false`). `GET` returns eligibility map. DB: `neighborhoods.created_at` column (null for existing = not eligible).
- **Report:** Users can report others' community neighborhoods. Inline "Report" link with reason input. API: `POST /api/neighborhoods/report`. DB: `neighborhood_reports` table (unique per neighborhood+reporter). "Reported" label replaces link after submission.
- **Luxury empty state:** Community neighborhoods with 0 articles show "Initializing Coverage Protocol" with pulsing dot instead of generic "No articles yet". Feed page queries `is_community` from neighborhoods table.

### Dynamic House Ads ("Check Out a New Neighborhood")
- **DB record:** `house_ads` where `type = 'app_download'` updated: headline "Check Out a New Neighborhood", body "See what's happening today in a nearby neighborhood.", click_url `/discover` (static fallback)
- **Shared utility:** `src/lib/discover-neighborhood.ts` - `findDiscoveryBrief(supabase, subscribedIds, referenceNeighborhoodId, options?)` returns `{ url, neighborhoodName }` or null. `DiscoveryOptions`: `mode` (`'nearby'` default, or `'random'`), `excludeCity` (for random diversity).
- **Logic:** Fetches active non-combo neighborhoods, filters out subscribed. Nearby mode: sorts by Haversine distance. Random mode: Fisher-Yates shuffle, excludes specified city. Tries top 10 for a published Daily Brief article.
- **Email integration:** `src/lib/email/ads.ts` - `getHouseAd()` accepts `subscribedIds`/`primaryNeighborhoodId`, resolves dynamic URL for `app_download` type via `findDiscoveryBrief()`
- **Web integration:** `HouseAdDisplay` in `FallbackAd.tsx` - `useEffect` reads localStorage prefs, fetches `/api/discover-neighborhood?subscribedIds=...&referenceId=...`, updates click URL from `/discover` to resolved brief URL
- **API endpoint:** `GET /api/discover-neighborhood` - public, no auth, accepts `mode` and `excludeCity` query params, calls `findDiscoveryBrief()`, returns `{ url, neighborhoodName }` or `{ url: "/discover" }` fallback
- **Brief card CTAs:** `NeighborhoodBrief.tsx` - when expanded, shows discovery links below source attribution: "Read yesterday's [Name] Daily Brief", "Read today's nearby [Name] Daily Brief" (nearby mode), and "Take me somewhere new" (random mode, excludes current city). Lazy-fetched on first expand (three parallel API calls), cached in component state.
- **Brief article CTAs:** `BriefDiscoveryFooter.tsx` - on daily brief article pages, unified "Keep reading" section right after source attribution: yesterday's brief, add to neighborhoods (if not subscribed), nearby brief, "take me somewhere new", and inline email capture ("Get them emailed 7am daily"). Current neighborhood excluded from discovery candidates.
- **Yesterday's brief API:** `GET /api/briefs/yesterday?neighborhoodId=...&excludeSlug=...` - returns previous brief article URL for a neighborhood.

### Add to Collection CTA (Article Pages)
- **Component:** `AddToCollectionCTA` (private, inline in `FallbackAd.tsx`) - shows "Add {neighborhoodName} to Your Collection" on article bottom ad slot when the neighborhood is not in user's collection
- **Props:** `articleNeighborhoodId` and `articleNeighborhoodName` passed from article page to bottom `FallbackAd` only
- **Logic:** `useEffect` checks `flaneur-neighborhood-preferences` localStorage. If neighborhood already present, returns null (normal fallback renders). On click: adds to localStorage array, fires `POST /api/neighborhoods/add` (fire-and-forget DB sync), shows success state.
- **API endpoint:** `POST /api/neighborhoods/add` - accepts `{ neighborhoodId }`, uses `getSession()` auth. Authenticated: inserts into `user_neighborhood_preferences` (with next sort_order). Anonymous: returns success (localStorage-only).
- **Placement:** Bottom ad slot only on article pages (`position="bottom"`). Top slot remains normal house ad/fallback.

## Key Patterns

### Feed Neighborhood Cookie
- **Cookie:** `flaneur-neighborhoods` - comma-separated neighborhood IDs, `SameSite=Strict`, `path=/`, 1-year `max-age`
- **Source of truth:** DB `user_neighborhood_preferences` for logged-in users (synced to localStorage on mount + tab focus via `useNeighborhoodPreferences`). `flaneur-neighborhood-preferences` localStorage for anonymous users. Cookie is a sync copy for server-side reading.
- **Server reading:** `feed/page.tsx` reads `cookies().get('flaneur-neighborhoods')` from `next/headers` to pre-fetch articles, briefs, weather, ads server-side.
- **Sync points:** Cookie is synced from localStorage at every navigation to `/feed` - inline `<script>` in `layout.tsx` (pre-hydration), plus explicit `document.cookie` set before `router.push('/feed')` or `router.refresh()` in all client components that modify neighborhoods.
- **Utility:** `src/lib/neighborhood-cookie.ts` - `NEIGHBORHOODS_COOKIE` constant, `syncNeighborhoodCookie()` client function
- **Why cookie not URL:** Prevents long URLs with 25+ neighborhoods, prevents abuse (anyone could construct a custom feed URL), `SameSite=Strict` keeps data browser-local
- **Clearing:** `NeighborhoodSelectorModal.clearAll()` sets cookie to empty (`max-age=0`)

### Primary Neighborhood Sync
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/location/sync-primary-neighborhood` - syncs primary neighborhood change to DB for email scheduler
- **Called from:** `useNeighborhoodPreferences.setPrimary()` (fire-and-forget, covers ContextSwitcher, modal, drag-reorder)
- **Logic:** Uses `getSession()` (not `getUser()`), looks up neighborhood city, updates `profiles.primary_city`/`primary_timezone`/`primary_neighborhood_id`, triggers instant resend on any primary change (same city or different)
- **DB columns:** `profiles.primary_city` (text), `profiles.primary_timezone` (text), `profiles.primary_neighborhood_id` (FK to neighborhoods.id)
- **Email scheduler:** Uses `primary_neighborhood_id` directly if set, falls back to first neighborhood matching `primary_city` for backwards compatibility
- **Anonymous users:** Silent no-op (returns success)

### Cron Jobs
- All in `src/app/api/cron/[job-name]/route.ts`
- Auth: `x-vercel-cron` header or `CRON_SECRET`
- **MUST** log to `cron_executions` table
- Use `maxDuration = 300` for long-running jobs
- Use time budgets to ensure logging completes in `try/finally`

### Daily Content Health Monitor
- **Cron:** `check-daily-health` (`0 10 * * *`, maxDuration=60)
- **9 checks:** Brief coverage, content quality (enrichment + paragraph count), hyperlinks in enriched content, HTML artifacts in article bodies, translation coverage, email delivery, story images, editorial sources (brief_summary/look_ahead/weekly_recap articles shouldn't have source rows), URL-encoded text (`%20`/`%2C`/etc. in article bodies)
- **Output:** Creates `cron_issues` for auto-fixable problems (picked up by `monitor-and-fix` on next 30-min cycle), emails admin summary report with pass/warn/fail per check
- **Issue types:** `missing_sunday_edition` (manual), `unenriched_brief` (auto-fix via re-enrichment), `thin_brief` (manual), `missing_hyperlinks` (auto-fix via re-enrichment), `html_artifact` (manual), `editorial_sources` (auto-fix: delete inappropriate source rows), `url_encoded_text` (auto-fix: decodeURIComponent on body)
- **Auto-fixer (`monitor-and-fix`):** Runs every 30 min. `getRetryableIssues()` fetches up to 50 open issues from the last 7 days, newest first. Route dispatches all fixable types through `attemptFix()` with per-type rate limits: images (5/run), thin content (10/run), emails (10/run), enrichment i.e. unenriched_brief + missing_hyperlinks (5/run, 2s delay), DB-only fixes like missing_sources/url_encoded_text (no limit). Non-auto-fixable types (job_failure, html_artifact, thin_brief) are skipped.
- **Files:** `src/lib/cron-monitor/health-checks.ts` (check functions), `src/lib/cron-monitor/auto-fixer.ts` (auto-fix handlers), `src/lib/cron-monitor/health-report-email.ts` (email template), `src/app/api/cron/check-daily-health/route.ts` (cron endpoint), `src/app/api/cron/monitor-and-fix/route.ts` (auto-fix cron), `src/lib/cron-monitor/issue-detector.ts` (issue detection + retryable query), `src/lib/cron-monitor/types.ts` (FIX_CONFIG constants)

### Article Deduplication (sync-news)
- **RSS articles:** Deterministic `generateSlug()` (djb2 hash, no timestamp) + source URL check in `editor_notes`
- **Grok articles:** Headline similarity check (first 40 chars, same neighborhood, last 24h) + deterministic slug
- **Fashion week:** Slug includes day number; prompt requires "Day N" in headline with day-specific angle

### Gemini Enrichment (enrich-briefs)
- **Model strategy:** Pro for briefs, Flash for articles. Phase 1 (daily briefs) always uses `gemini-2.5-pro` for highest quality. Phase 2 (RSS articles) always uses `gemini-2.5-flash`. Model split logged in `response_data` (`model_pro_used`/`model_flash_used`).
- **Schedule:** `*/15`, batch size 30, concurrency 4, Phase 1 budget 200s
- **Backoff:** Exponential retry on 429/RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED (2s, 5s, 15s delays)
- **Early termination:** Drains queue if any batch call hits quota
- **Two phases:** Phase 1 = briefs (200s budget, Pro), Phase 2 = RSS articles only (remaining ~80s, Flash). Phase 2 skips `brief_summary` and `look_ahead` articles — they're already enriched by their own pipelines and must not be re-enriched with the wrong style.
- **Greeting:** CRITICAL formatting rule requires "Good morning, {neighborhood}" as the very first line of every daily brief. Reinforced in both style section and formatting rules to ensure Pro compliance.
- **Language:** Prompt requires English output with local language terms sprinkled in naturally (Swedish greetings, French venue names, etc.). Prevents Gemini from writing entirely in the local language when searching local-language sources.
- **Daily framing:** Prompt explicitly states "This is a DAILY update" and prohibits weekly/monthly framing ("another week", "this week's roundup")
- **Link preservation:** Gemini's Google Search grounding naturally includes markdown links in prose. These are preserved in `enriched_content` (not stripped). Render-time components convert them to clickable `<a>` tags.
- **Continuity context:** `fetchContinuityContext()` in cron fetches last 5 enriched briefs (headline + 200-char sentence-truncated excerpt) and last 3 days of non-brief articles (headline + article_type). Injected as `RECENT COVERAGE CONTEXT` block in prompt. Enables natural back-references ("as we noted Tuesday..."). ~300-800 extra tokens per prompt. Optional param (`continuityContext`), backward compatible. Only applies to daily briefs (not weekly recaps). Non-fatal on fetch failure.
- **Subject teaser:** Gemini generates a 1-4 word "information gap" teaser in the enrichment JSON response (`subject_teaser` field). Stored in `neighborhood_briefs.subject_teaser`. Validated: 1-5 words, max 40 chars. Zero extra API calls. Used by email sender for Morning Brew-style subject lines (e.g., "Rent freeze showdown", "The bakery switch"). Falls back to headline-based teaser when null or too long for 70-char subject limit.

### Brief Generation Timezone Handling (sync-neighborhood-briefs)
- **Morning window:** Midnight-7 AM local time (28 chances at `*/15`, survives 6h cron gaps). Starts at midnight to give 7h for full pipeline before 7 AM email.
- **Concurrency:** 3 parallel Grok calls per run (~27-30 briefs per run vs ~9-10 sequential). Each Grok brief takes ~25-30s.
- **Dedup:** `hasBriefForLocalToday()` uses `toLocaleDateString('en-CA', { timeZone })` per neighborhood
- **NOT UTC midnight:** Fetches last 36h of briefs, checks each against its local "today"
- **Content sanitization:** Both `grok.ts` and `NeighborhoodBrief.cleanContent()` strip raw Grok search result objects (`{'title': ..., 'url': ...}`) that occasionally leak into brief text
- **Grok citation stripping:** All Grok headline parsing must strip citation markers (`[[1]](url)`, `[1]`, `(1)`) via a 4-pattern regex chain (remove `[[n]](url)`, remove `[n]`, remove `(n)`, collapse double spaces). Applied in `generateNeighborhoodBrief()`, `generateGrokNewsStories()`, and `generateLookAhead()`. Without this, URLs leak into headlines and slugs.

### Image Library (Unsplash Stock Photos)
- **Core:** `src/lib/image-library.ts` - types, `selectLibraryImage()`, `getLibraryReadyIds()`, `checkLibraryStatus()`, module-level LRU cache (1hr TTL) for Unsplash photos
- **Unsplash client:** `src/lib/unsplash.ts` - API client with interleaved dual-query search in `searchAllCategories()`: two parallel searches `"{name} {city}"` (30 results, for city-disambiguation) + `"{name}"` alone (30 results, for iconic/popular shots), interleaved via alternating merge and deduped by photo ID. City-qualified results take odd positions (1,3,5...), name-only take even (2,4,6...) so the 8 assigned categories get a mix of accurate and visually striking photos. Handles ambiguous names (SoHo, Downtown, Midtown) since city-qualified results take priority in the interleave. Falls back to city-only `"{city}"` and city+country `"{city} {country}"` if combined results < 8. Accepts optional `country` param. Throws on rate limit (403/429) so crons can stop early. Triggers download endpoint for attribution tracking (required by Unsplash terms). Cost: 2 API calls per neighborhood (well within 5000/hr budget).
- **Generator:** `src/lib/image-library-generator.ts` - calls `searchAllCategories()`, stores results in `image_library_status.unsplash_photos` JSONB. ~200ms per neighborhood. Returns `{ photos_found, errors }`.
- **Unsplash CDN URLs:** Hotlinked per Unsplash terms (no downloading/re-hosting). Format: `images.unsplash.com/...&w=1200&q=80&fm=webp`. Already in `next.config.ts` remotePatterns.
- **Categories (8 per neighborhood):** `daily-brief-1/2/3` (rotated by day % 3), `look-ahead-1/2/3` (rotated by day % 3), `sunday-edition` (single), `rss-story` (single)
- **Selection:** `selectLibraryImage(neighborhoodId, articleType, categoryLabel?, libraryReadyIds?)` - checks Unsplash cache first, falls back to old Supabase Storage URLs.
- **Cache preload required:** All crons using `selectLibraryImage()` must call `preloadUnsplashCache(supabase)` at startup. The Unsplash photos live in `image_library_status.unsplash_photos` JSONB and are loaded into an in-memory module-level cache. Without preloading, `selectLibraryImage()` falls back to legacy Supabase Storage AI images. Applies to 7 crons: generate-brief-articles, generate-look-ahead, generate-guide-digests, sync-news, sync-weekly-brief, generate-community-news, retry-missing-images.
- **Attribution:** Article pages (`[slug]/page.tsx`) display "Photo by [Name] on Unsplash" with UTM-tagged links below Unsplash images. Credit resolved from `image_library_status.unsplash_photos` JSONB.
- **Admin endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/generate-image-library` - single (`neighborhoodId`) or batch mode. `GET` returns status counts.
- **Automated refresh:** `refresh-image-library` cron (`0 */4 * * *`, every 4 hours). Stops on rate limit. Quarterly seasonal refresh for variety. Emails admin on completion.
- **Rate limits:** Production: 5000/hr (all 273 in one run).
- **Cost:** $0 (Unsplash API is free)
- **DB:** `image_library_status` table - `unsplash_photos` JSONB column stores `{ "category": { id, url, photographer, photographer_url, download_location } }` per neighborhood. Legacy `images_generated` column kept for backward compat.
- **Fallback chain:** Unsplash cache → DB Unsplash lookup → old Supabase Storage URLs → empty string (retry-missing-images fills later)
- **generate-image endpoint:** Library lookup + sensitive headline check + SVG placeholder only (no more Gemini Image generation)
- **retry-missing-images cron:** Library-only (no generate-image fallback). Skips HEAD check for Unsplash CDN URLs.
- **Cron category images:** `src/lib/cron-images.ts` (22 categories for specialized crons - fashion-week, escape-index, etc. - unchanged)

### Email System
- **Scheduler:** `src/lib/email/scheduler.ts` — 7 AM local time per recipient
- **Assembler:** `src/lib/email/assembler.ts` — explicit `fetchBriefAsStory()` + `fetchLookAheadAsStory()` per section (primary + each satellite), 2 stories per neighborhood (1 Daily Brief + 1 Look Ahead, 48h lookback). `isGreetingOnly()` regex detects greeting-only preview text (multilingual), `extractSentences()` splits text at sentence boundaries while skipping single-letter initials (e.g., "Solomon R."), falls back to first 2 non-greeting sentences of `body_text`. Dateline in category labels.
- **Sender:** `src/lib/email/sender.ts` — React Email via Resend. Sender name always "Flaneur News" (extracts email from `EMAIL_FROM` env var, wraps with display name). Daily Brief subject: `{teaser}, {neighborhood}` all lowercase (under 70 chars, e.g., "toughest table, west village"). Prefers Gemini-generated teaser from `neighborhood_briefs.subject_teaser`, falls back to lead headline (word-boundary truncated). No "Daily Brief:" prefix. Fallback when no teaser: `your morning brief, {neighborhood}`. Preview text: "Your morning brief from {Neighborhood}+" (+ appended when satellite neighborhoods exist).
- **Sunday Edition subject:** `{teaser}, {neighborhood}` all lowercase (matches Daily Brief format). Gemini-generated teaser from `weekly_briefs.subject_teaser` preferred, falls back to lead headline truncated at word boundary, last resort `your sunday edition, {neighborhood}`. `buildSundaySubject()` defined in both cron and on-demand routes.
- **Sunday Edition:** `src/lib/weekly-brief-service.ts` — Gemini Pro-first/Flash-fallback + Grok. Cron checks Pro RPD usage at start, uses Pro until budget exhausted (~5 calls/neighborhood), then falls back to Flash. Model param threaded through all 7 Gemini calls. Sections: The Letter, The Next Few Days, That Time of Year, Data Point, Your Other Editions. Cron processes 5 neighborhoods concurrently (~10/run at 280s budget). Schedule: `0 * * * 6,0` (hourly Saturday + Sunday, 48h window for full 270 neighborhood coverage). Enrichment uses `weeklyRecapStyle` which forces Sunday framing regardless of processing day.
- **Holiday system:** 50 holidays across 20 countries. Local holidays listed before global so `detectUpcomingHoliday()` prioritizes them (e.g., Lunar New Year over Valentine's Day for Singapore). `detectUpcomingHoliday` accepts optional `referenceDate` param (publication `weekDate`) to anchor the 7-day window to the edition date, not generation time - prevents past holidays from appearing when briefs are generated days before publication. Fixed-date and nth-weekday holidays use calculation; lunar/Islamic/Hebrew/Hindu holidays use lookup tables (2025-2030). Regions: East Asian (CNY, Mid-Autumn, Dragon Boat), Japanese (Golden Week, Obon, Coming of Age), Islamic (Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha), Jewish (Passover, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Hanukkah), Indian (Diwali, Vesak), European national days, South African, UAE National Day, plus existing Western holidays.
- **Data Point voice:** Prompts reference neighborhood by name ("The Tribeca median listing", "Crime in Nolita is holding steady") instead of "we/our" possessive voice. Never use "we/our/us" in data point context - sounds too possessive for real estate/safety data.
- **Weather:** Pure logic in `src/lib/email/weather-story.ts` (no LLM). Priority hierarchy: 1) Safety/Extremes (blizzard, extreme heat) → red-bordered WeatherStoryCard, 2) Travel & Lunch (weekday rain probability) → thin-bordered `tomorrowBox`, 3) Weekend Lookahead (Thu/Fri only), 4) General Anomaly (forecast vs climate normals). Non-alert stories (priority 2-4) render in thin-bordered box (`tomorrowBox` style, `backgroundColor: '#fafafa'`) in `DailyBriefTemplate.tsx` with 13px #999999 text (each sentence on own line). Weather body references the forecast day explicitly. All probability displays use "% prob" suffix.
- **Hero block:** `{neighborhood} · {city}` (12px tracked caps) + temperature (48px Playfair Display, clickable link to Google weather search) + weather description + weather story hint (non-alerts only, 13px grey) - merged as one centered visual thought, no label
- **Temperature:** Single-unit: °F for USA, °C for everyone else. Sunday Edition data point same logic.
- **US neighborhoods:** °F only. Determined by `neighborhoods.country`
- **Instant resend:** `src/lib/email/instant-resend.ts` (3/day resend limit)
- **Global daily email limit:** `src/lib/email/daily-email-limit.ts` - max 5 content emails per recipient per day (UTC), checked across `daily_brief_sends` + `weekly_brief_sends`. Wired into daily brief sender, instant resend, Sunday Edition cron, and on-demand Sunday Edition request. Transactional emails (password reset, ad confirmations) are exempt.
- **Layout:** Primary stories use compact `StoryList variant="primary"` (19px/16px), no hero image. Native ad after all primary stories (bordered frame, 1px solid #eeeeee, 4px radius).
- **Section headers:** Always `{neighborhood} · {city}` - no smart geography hiding. City in muted `#b0b0b0`.
- **Section dividers:** `SectionDivider` component - centered wide-tracked uppercase `{name} · {city}` + 32px gold accent rule (`rgba(120, 53, 15, 0.4)`). When combined text exceeds 25 chars, city renders on separate centered line below neighborhood name (prevents word-wrap on mobile for long names like "Greenwich Backcountry · New York Surroundings"). Same stacking logic in `DailyBriefTemplate.tsx` hero block.
- **Truncation:** `truncateAtSentence()` (160 chars) for both primary (`StoryList`) and satellite (`SatelliteSection`) preview text. No CSS line-clamp (was causing Gmail to render "..." dots instead of content).
- **Metadata word wrap:** `StoryList.tsx` drops city from location when combined `categoryLabel · location` exceeds 50 chars (shows just neighborhood name).
- **Preview text:** Uses plain hidden `<div>` instead of react-email `<Preview>` component. The `@react-email/preview` component injects 100+ invisible Unicode filler characters that Gmail renders as a visible "..." bubble. Both DailyBriefTemplate and SundayEditionTemplate use `previewHidden` style constant.
- **Typography:** Playfair Display via Google Fonts `@import` (Apple Mail renders; Gmail falls back to Georgia serif). All headlines, masthead, temperature use serif.
- **Masthead:** "FLANEUR" is a clickable link to `readflaneur.com` in both Daily Brief (`Header.tsx`) and Sunday Edition templates. Styled to match surrounding text (no underline).
- **Ad fallback:** `src/lib/email/ads.ts` - paid ads first, then random house ad from `house_ads` table. `app_download` type resolves dynamic discovery brief URL via `findDiscoveryBrief()`. NativeAd supports body text, centered layout, bordered frame (1px solid, 4px radius). Image wrapped in `{ad.imageUrl && (...)}` to prevent alt text rendering as blue link when no image exists. Sunday Edition sponsor ad has matching bordered frame (1px solid #e8e0d4).
- **Category labels:** `cleanCategoryLabel()` in assembler.ts strips neighborhood prefix, then renames "Daily Brief" to "Daily Brief (Today)" and "Look Ahead" to "Look Ahead (next 7 days)" for email display. Accepts optional `publishedAt` param — only shows "(Today)" when article is actually from today via `isSameDay()` check. Appended with dateline: "Daily Brief (Today) - Wed Feb 18".
- **Footer "forwarded" CTA:** "Was this forwarded to you? Subscribe here — it's free." shown in all emails. Daily Brief: rendered by `Footer.tsx`. Sunday Edition: inline in `SundayEditionTemplate.tsx`. Links to `/invite`.
- **Welcome email deliverability coaching:** `buildMagicLinkEmail()` in `subscribe/route.ts` includes platform-specific inbox tips after Verify Email button (Gmail Primary tab, Apple Mail VIPs, add to contacts).
- **Welcome email "Here's what to expect" grid:** 2x2 grid + bonus row between CTA and deliverability coaching showing Daily Brief, Look Ahead, Sunday Edition, Family Corner, Escape Mode features.
- **Inline referral CTA:** "Know someone who'd enjoy this? Share Flaneur or forward this email." After primary stories in `DailyBriefTemplate.tsx`, before footer in `SundayEditionTemplate.tsx`. Only renders when `referralUrl` exists.
- **Share links on lead story:** `StoryList.tsx` renders "Share on X / Facebook" (Twitter intent + Facebook sharer URLs) below the first story in primary sections only (`isPrimary && i === 0`).
- **Email divider hierarchy:** Primary story dividers `#d5d5d5`. Full-width `#999999` divider between primary and satellite sections (`DailyBriefTemplate.tsx`). Satellite section dividers full-width `#e0e0e0` (replaced 32px amber). Light `#e5e5e5` dividers between satellite stories.
- **Deduplication:** assembler.ts tracks seen article URLs in a Set - same story never appears in both primary and satellite sections
- **On-demand secondary editions:** `src/app/api/email/sunday-edition-request/route.ts` - two-step confirmation (prevents email client prefetch). Template shows "Your Other Editions" links for secondary neighborhoods. Dedup index: `(recipient_id, neighborhood_id, week_date)`. Rate limit: 5 on-demand sends per week. On-demand emails do NOT include secondary neighborhood buttons (no recursion).

### Ad System
- **Pricing:** `src/config/ad-tiers.ts`, `src/lib/PricingService.ts` — flat per-day rates (Tier 1: $500/$750, Tier 2: $200/$300, Tier 3: $100/$150)

- **Booking:** `/advertise` page with `react-day-picker` calendar → Stripe Checkout → asset upload → AI review
- **Placement toggle:** `CollectionsWithPlacement.tsx` — Daily Brief / Sunday Edition toggle between Collections header and pricing cards, highlights active pricing
- **Availability:** `GET /api/ads/availability` — booked/blocked dates + pricing per neighborhood/month
- **Checkout:** `POST /api/ads/checkout` — accepts `neighborhoodIds[]` array, creates N ads + N Stripe line items, 48h–90d window
- **Upload:** `/advertise/upload/[adId]` — sponsor label, headline, body, image, click URL (one per neighborhood)
- **Success:** `/advertise/success` — post-payment confirmation with per-neighborhood upload links
- **Quality:** `src/lib/ad-quality-service.ts` — Gemini image analysis + copy polisher
- **Proof page:** `/proofs/[token]` — no auth, token-based
- **Approval flow:** `pending_payment` → `pending_assets` → `in_review` → `active` (via admin approval)
- **AI quality:** `pending_ai` → `pending_approval` → `approved` / `changes_requested`
- **Sunday ad resolver:** `src/lib/email/sunday-ad-resolver.ts` — date-aware cascade with house ad fallback
- **Date-aware delivery:** `src/lib/email/ads.ts` and `src/lib/ad-engine.ts` filter by `start_date <= today <= end_date`
- **Multi-neighborhood:** Calendar shows merged availability, pills UI for selection (with combo component names), combo component search (e.g. "FiDi" finds Tribeca)
- **Double-booking prevention:** unique composite index on `(neighborhood_id, placement_type, start_date)`
- **Stripe session:** `stripe_session_id` shared across N ads from same checkout (not unique)
- **Global takeover:** $10,000/day or $15,000/Sunday, contact-only (`ads@readflaneur.com`)
- **Storage:** `ad-assets` Supabase bucket for uploaded ad images

### Enhanced Neighborhood Search
- **Shared search:** `src/lib/search-aliases.ts` — country/region/state aliases + `resolveSearchQuery()` with priority scoring
- **Geo utils:** `src/lib/geo-utils.ts` — Haversine distance, `sortByDistance()`, `formatDistance()`
- **Advertise page:** `AdBookingCalendar.tsx` — searches by name/city/component/country/region/state, "Near me" geolocation, grouped city headers for broad queries, "Select all in city"
- **Header modal:** `NeighborhoodSelectorModal.tsx` — "City Search" dark glassmorphism UI (`bg-neutral-900/90 backdrop-blur-md`), CSS columns masonry layout, text-based items (not pills), amber accent system for selected/vacation/enclave, toggle select/deselect per city, "Change Primary" link in header (scrolls to + highlights primary), "Clear all" with two-tap confirmation in footer, slide-up + backdrop-fade animations. Mobile: `inset-x-0 top-2 bottom-0` (full-bleed bottom) with `pb-[max(1rem,env(safe-area-inset-bottom))]` on footer for iOS safe area. Settings section (city dropdown + detect + save) above footer. `handleExplore()` uses localStorage order (primary-first).
- **Settings in modal:** City/timezone settings merged into neighborhood modal (compact row above footer). Settings links removed from Header nav (desktop + mobile). `/settings` page still accessible via direct URL.
- **Accent-insensitive search:** NFD normalization strips diacritical marks — "ostermalm" matches "Östermalm"
- **Alias suppression:** when query matches a country/region/state alias, loose substring matches are suppressed (prevents "US" matching "Justicia")
- **Sort by nearest:** "Sort by nearest to me" button below search input, geolocation-based sorting
- **Sort by region:** "Sort by region" button next to nearest — groups cities into geographic sections (North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, Asia & Pacific) with headers. Toggles to "Sort alphabetically" when active. Vacation/enclave regions mapped to geographic parent.
- **Timezone tooltip:** "Change my Timezone" button shows hover tooltip explaining it controls 7am email delivery time

### Article Search
- **Page:** `/search` (`src/app/search/page.tsx`) - full-page search with X close button (`router.back()`), rounded-lg inputs/buttons/cards
- **API:** `GET /api/search?q={query}` - searches articles by headline, body, preview text via Supabase `ilike`. Max 50 results.
- **Header icon:** Magnifying glass in both desktop nav and mobile icon bar, links to `/search`
- **Results:** Thumbnail + neighborhood (uppercase tracked) + time ago + headline. Excerpts hidden on mobile.

### Combo Neighborhoods
- `src/lib/combo-utils.ts` — `getNeighborhoodIdsForQuery()`, `getComboInfo()`, `getComboForComponent()`
- Articles stored under component IDs (e.g., `nyc-fidi`, `nyc-tribeca-core`), not the combo ID (`nyc-tribeca`)
- Query must include BOTH combo ID and component IDs — use `combo_neighborhoods` table to expand
- `/feed` page does early combo expansion via `combo_neighborhoods` table, passes `combo_component_ids` to client components. `MultiFeed` uses `in.(id1,id2,id3)` for REST queries when a combo pill is selected.
- Article detail page uses `getComboForComponent()` to show parent combo name as a breadcrumb link for component neighborhood articles
- Dedicated neighborhood pages (`/[city]/[neighborhood]/page.tsx`) already use `getNeighborhoodIdsForQuery()` — no fix needed

### Reactions System
- **Table:** `article_reactions` (bookmark, heart) — replaces comments. Fire emoji removed.
- **API:** `src/app/api/reactions/route.ts` — GET counts, POST toggle
- **Saved:** `src/app/api/reactions/saved/route.ts` + `/saved` page
- **Component:** `src/components/article/ArticleReactions.tsx` — compact inline (no borders), optimistic UI, anonymous via localStorage
- Anonymous ID stored in `flaneur-anonymous-id` localStorage key

### Sentry Monitoring
- **Project:** `flaneur-web` (org: `flaneur-vk`, project ID: `4510840235884544`)
- **SDK:** `@sentry/nextjs` v10 — client via `src/instrumentation-client.ts`, server/edge via `sentry.{server,edge}.config.ts`
- **Tunnel:** `/monitoring` route (bypasses ad blockers)
- **Trace rate:** 20% on all configs, session replays off, error replays 100%
- **API token:** `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env.local` (read-only scope — can query issues but cannot resolve them; needs `event:write` for mutations)

### AI Model Management
- **Central config:** `src/config/ai-models.ts` - all model IDs in one place
- **Automated checker:** `src/app/api/cron/check-ai-models/route.ts` - monthly cron (1st at 9 AM UTC)
  - Phase 1: Gemini `models.list` API - checks our models exist + finds newer versions
  - Phase 2: Grok web search (3 queries, one per provider) for releases/deprecations
  - Creates `model_update_available` issues in `cron_issues` for admin review
  - Cost: ~$0.015/month
- **Provider docs:** [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models), [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models), [xAI/Grok](https://docs.x.ai/developers/models)
- **Current models:** Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash (enrichment fallback/translation), Gemini 2.5 Pro (enrichment primary + Sunday Edition, 1K RPD budget), Grok 4.1 Fast. Image library now uses Unsplash API (no AI image generation).
- **Import pattern:** `import { AI_MODELS } from '@/config/ai-models'` then use `AI_MODELS.GEMINI_FLASH` etc.
- **Cron metadata:** DB `ai_model` fields use short names (`'gemini-2.5-flash'`, `'claude-sonnet-4-5'`) not full version IDs

## Critical Gotchas

### VERCEL_URL vs NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
`VERCEL_URL` points to preview deployments, NOT production. Always use:
```typescript
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL?.replace(/\n$/, '').replace(/\/$/, '')
  || (process.env.VERCEL_URL ? `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}` : 'http://localhost:3000');
```

### Supabase Auth: getUser() vs getSession()
- `getUser()` = network call, can hang. `getSession()` = cookies, instant.
- **Always use `getSession()`** in middleware/pages/components
- Add timeout wrappers (3-5s `Promise.race`) for auth/DB calls in UI

### Supabase PromiseLike
No `.catch()` on query builder. Use `.then(null, errorHandler)` or `Promise.resolve(query).catch(...)`.

### Supabase Foreign Key Joins
`neighborhood:neighborhoods(id, name, city)` returns a single **object**, not an array. Don't use `[0]` on the result.

### Gemini Prompts
JSON examples override prose instructions. If prompt says "Don't use AQI" but example shows `"AQI 42"`, Gemini follows the example.

### overflow-x: hidden Breaks Sticky Positioning
CSS spec: setting `overflow-x: hidden` forces `overflow-y: auto` (can't mix `hidden` with `visible`). This creates a scrolling context that captures `position: sticky` elements, breaking their viewport-relative behavior. **Use `overflow-x: clip` instead** — clips without creating a scrolling context. Applied in `globals.css` on `<main>`.

### Gmail Strips Anchor Links
Never use `<a href="#section-id">` in email templates — Gmail strips anchor hrefs entirely. Use plain `<Text>` labels instead (e.g., "Family Corner below" instead of a jump link).

### No Em Dashes
Never use em dashes (—) in user-facing text. Use hyphens (-) instead. Em dashes look AI-generated.

### Theme System (Light/Dark)
- **Default:** Dark mode. Toggle via sun/moon icon in Header (desktop nav + mobile hamburger area)
- **localStorage key:** `flaneur-theme` (`'dark'` | `'light'`, absence = dark)
- **Flash prevention:** Inline `<script>` in `layout.tsx` sets `data-theme` attribute before first paint
- **CSS variables:** Semantic tokens in `globals.css` `:root` (dark) and `[data-theme="light"]` (light)
- **Hook:** `useTheme()` from `src/hooks/useTheme.ts` - `{ theme, setTheme, toggleTheme }`
- **Component:** `ThemeToggle` from `src/components/layout/ThemeToggle.tsx`
- **Semantic Tailwind classes:** `text-fg`, `text-fg-muted`, `text-fg-subtle`, `bg-canvas`, `bg-surface`, `bg-elevated`, `border-border`, `border-border-strong`, `hover:bg-hover`, `hover:text-fg`, `text-accent`, `text-accent-muted`
- **Accent color:** `--theme-accent` - `#fbbf24` (amber-400) in dark, `#b45309` (amber-700) in light. Use `text-accent` for selected/interactive states that need contrast in both themes. `text-accent-muted` for softer variant.
- **Light palette:** Stone shades (warm undertone) - canvas `#fafaf9`, surface `#ffffff`, fg `#1c1917`
- **Dark palette:** Canvas `#050505`, Surface `#121212`, fg `#e5e5e5`
- **Buttons:** `.btn-primary` = `bg-fg text-canvas` hover amber-600, `.btn-secondary` = `bg-transparent text-fg border-border-strong`, `.btn-ghost` = `text-fg-muted` hover text-fg
- **Header:** `.header-bg` class (CSS var `--theme-header-bg`) + `backdrop-blur`, `border-border`
- **Force-dark sections:** Homepage hero, discover hero, invite hero use `data-theme="dark"` to scope all children to dark CSS variables
- **Gradient fades:** Use `from-canvas` (tracks theme automatically)
- **Article prose:** Semantic text classes (`text-fg`, `text-fg-muted`) instead of `prose-invert`
- **DO NOT touch:** email templates in `src/lib/email/` (must stay light for mail clients)
- **DO NOT touch:** `src/components/home/` (hero components, excluded from theme sweep)

### Homepage Hero ("Cinematic Dark Mode")
- **Background:** `bg-black` base + `radial-gradient(ellipse at top, rgba(30,30,30,1), rgba(0,0,0,1) 70%)` overlay for tonal depth (CSS-only, no image asset)
- **FLANEUR:** `text-6xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl` Cormorant Garamond serif, `tracking-[0.3em]`. Plain `<h1>` (no link wrapper - the "Read Stories" button is the CTA).
- **Tagline:** `tracking-[0.5em] uppercase`, `text-sm md:text-base`, neutral-400
- **Animations:** Staggered `heroFadeIn` keyframes in `globals.css` - 1.5s ease-out with 0.3s delays between elements (logo, tagline, stats, rule, "Read Stories" button at delay-4/1.2s)
- **Padding:** `py-28 md:py-36 lg:py-48` for cinematic breathing room
- **No neighborhood chips:** Homepage shows only hero + stats + button. `HomeSignupEnhanced` (with neighborhood chips) removed from homepage, kept on `/discover`.

### NeighborhoodHeader (Feed Page)
- **Mode prop:** `mode: 'single' | 'all'` (default `'single'`). Controls masthead content and control deck layout.
- **Masthead (single):** Centered `text-center pt-8`. City label, serif neighborhood name, italic combo sub-line, `NeighborhoodLiveStatus` with `mb-8`.
- **Masthead (all):** Centered `text-center pt-2 md:pt-6` (tighter mobile). "My Neighborhoods" heading (clickable - opens NeighborhoodSelectorModal) + "{N} locations" subtitle when no pill active. When a pill is active: city + combo components on one line (dot separator), Maps/History links, LiveStatus. Subtitle conditionally rendered (not fixed-height invisible).
- **Maps/History links (all mode):** Small grey dotted-underline links (`text-xs text-neutral-500 decoration-dotted`) under neighborhood name. Only shown when a specific pill is active. Same URLs as single-mode MAP/HISTORY.
- **NeighborhoodLiveStatus:** `font-mono text-xs font-medium tracking-[0.2em] text-amber-600/80`. Clickable - Google weather. Accepts `initialWeather` prop for server-side pre-fetch (skips client fetch when provided).
- **Control Deck:** CSS Grid `grid-cols-[minmax(0,1fr)_auto_minmax(0,1fr)]` for overflow-safe centering. Left: `<ContextSwitcher>` (truncates long names), Center: GUIDE/MAP/HISTORY `hidden md:flex` on desktop, `...` overflow dropdown on mobile (`md:hidden`), Right: ViewToggle.
- **ContextSwitcher:** `src/components/feed/ContextSwitcher.tsx` - dropdown trigger (`{LABEL} ▾`, truncated `max-w-[80px] md:max-w-[200px]`) + popover (`bg-surface border-border-strong w-64 z-30`). Sections: "All Neighborhoods" (layers icon), neighborhood list (dot + name + city + primary badge + "Set primary" on hover with `hover:text-accent`), "Customize List..." (opens modal), "The Front Door" (house icon, links to `/discover`), "Invite a Friend" (via ShareWidget, shown only to subscribers). Click-outside + Escape close.
- **useNeighborhoodPreferences:** `src/hooks/useNeighborhoodPreferences.ts` - reads localStorage IDs, fetches name/city from Supabase, cross-tab sync via `storage` event. Exposes `primaryId` and `setPrimary(id)` to reorder localStorage array.
- **Primary neighborhood:** First item in localStorage array. Indicated across ContextSwitcher (amber dot + "PRIMARY" label), MultiFeed pill bar, HomeSignupEnhanced chips (on `/discover`), and NeighborhoodSelectorModal. Users can change primary via "Set primary" actions.
- **Combo dropdowns:** `bg-surface border-white/[0.08]`, items `hover:text-white hover:bg-white/5`
- **ViewToggle:** Desktop: two buttons (compact + gallery) in pill bar row, active `text-white`, inactive `text-neutral-300`. Mobile: rendered separately just above feed content (`md:hidden flex justify-end`), not in dropdown row.
- **DailyBriefWidget:** Renders between Control Deck and FeedList (passed as `dailyBrief` ReactNode prop to `NeighborhoodFeed` or `MultiFeed`). Spacing: `mt-8 mb-12`. Section headings in brief cards use `text-neutral-200` (brighter than body `text-neutral-400`). Brief headline is single-line (`whitespace-nowrap overflow-hidden`).
- **MultiFeed integration:** `MultiFeed` now uses `<NeighborhoodHeader mode="all">` instead of standalone header. Accepts `dailyBrief` and `initialWeather` props. Passes `comboComponentNames` for combo subtitle. Pill filter switches the daily brief dynamically - fetches brief from `neighborhood_briefs` table client-side per neighborhood, with skeleton loading state.
- **MultiFeed render order:** Neighborhood nav renders BEFORE masthead for vertical stability. Desktop pills `md:sticky` with `top: var(--header-offset, 64px)` (syncs with header hide/show via CSS variable). Opaque `md:bg-canvas` background. Mobile dropdown is not sticky. Left/right gradient fade indicators on desktop pill scroll container.
- **Header-pills sync:** Header sets `--header-offset` CSS variable on `<html>` (64px when visible, 0px when hidden on scroll-down). Pills transition smoothly via `transition-[top] duration-300 ease-in-out`. Eliminates gap where articles bleed through when header hides.
- **Back-to-top button:** `fixed bottom-6 right-4 z-40` on all screen sizes (previously top-center on desktop, which overlapped sticky pills).
- **Drag-to-reorder pills:** Desktop only. Neighborhood pills are `draggable` with pointer events. On drop: reorders localStorage, syncs cookie, calls `router.refresh()`. First pill = primary. Visual: dragged pill `opacity-50`, drop target amber left border, `cursor-grab`/`cursor-grabbing`. Mobile users reorder via the neighborhood selector modal.
- **ContextSwitcher setPrimary navigation:** `handleSetPrimary` syncs cookie from localStorage then calls `router.refresh()`, so MultiFeed reflects new primary immediately.
- **Shared slug utils:** `getCitySlugFromId()` and `getNeighborhoodSlugFromId()` in `neighborhood-utils.ts` replace duplicate helpers in MultiFeed, ComboNeighborhoodCards, feed/page.
- **ComboNeighborhoodCards:** Still exists for GuidesClient.tsx but removed from feed header

### Article Page Navigation
- **Back link:** `← ALL MY NEIGHBORHOOD STORIES` at top, links to `/feed` (the user's multi-neighborhood feed). No props needed.
- **Bottom CTA:** `MORE STORIES` button, also links to `/feed`. Both are simple parameterless components in `TranslatedArticleNav.tsx`.
- **Feed cookie:** Feed reads neighborhood IDs from `flaneur-neighborhoods` SameSite=Strict cookie (synced from localStorage by inline script in `layout.tsx`). `MultiFeed` detects empty `neighborhoods` prop, reads localStorage, syncs cookie, and calls `router.refresh()`.
- **Empty feed CTA:** When localStorage is also empty (new user from search), shows centered "Choose Neighborhoods" button that opens the selector modal instead of a dead-end empty state.
- **No neighborhood-specific links:** Article pages are entry points from shared links too - `/feed` loads the user's own neighborhood set regardless of which neighborhood the article belongs to
- **Source verification:** `SourceAttribution` shows source attribution for single-source articles. Props: `headline`, `neighborhoodName`, `editorNotes`, `category` passed from article page. Uses same dotted-underline academic link styling. Editorial categories (`brief_summary`, `look_ahead`, `weekly_recap`) suppress "verify here" entirely since they're AI-generated editorial content, not single-source news.
- **Government source attribution:** When `editor_notes` contains `Source: Name - URL` format, SourceAttribution displays a direct link to the authoritative government database (e.g., "NYC 311 Open Data"). The "Single-source story - verify here" fallback is NOT shown when a valid government source exists (government data is authoritative). 5 crons inject government source URLs into editor_notes: sync-nuisance-watch (NYC 311), sync-filming-permits (NYC Film Permits), sync-alfresco-permits (NYC Open Restaurants), sync-retail-watch (NYC DOB Signage), sync-nimby-alerts (dynamic per community board + agenda URL).
- **Nuisance watch location resolution:** `anonymizeAddress()` in `nuisance-watch.ts` uses 3-layer fallback: `street_name` -> extract street from `incident_address` (regex strips leading house numbers) -> cross streets (`cross_street_1`/`cross_street_2`). ALL CAPS 311 data converted via `titleCase()`. "0 Block of..." (house numbers 1-99) shows just street name. `clusterComplaints()` skips complaints with no resolvable location. `RawComplaint` interface includes optional `crossStreets` field.
- **Nuisance watch neighborhood roundups:** When 2+ complaint hotspots exist for the same neighborhood on the same day, the cron generates a single consolidated roundup article instead of separate per-location articles (e.g., "Noise Watch: 5 hotspots, 102 complaints across Upper West Side"). `generateNuisanceRoundup()` in `nuisance-watch.ts` uses Gemini to write a blurb mentioning top locations. `processNuisanceWatch()` returns `clusters` alongside `stories` so the cron can group by neighborhood. Single-hotspot neighborhoods still get individual articles. Roundup slug pattern: `nuisance-roundup-{neighborhoodId}-{date}`.
- **Nuisance watch story quality:** Both `generateNuisanceStory()` and `generateNuisanceRoundup()` must use exact date ranges (e.g., "Monday, February 12 through Wednesday, February 19") — never vague "this week". Ban "spike"/"surge" language since there is no historical comparison data. Roundup stories use structured bullet-point format (opening sentence, bullet list of hotspots with counts, closing sentence). Individual stories require exact dates in the body.
- **Civic data cron filter tuning:** Filming permits: 7-day lookahead (was 48h), includes Documentary/Music Video/Theater categories (was TV/Film/Commercial/WEB only). Retail watch: 30-day lookback (was 7d), ~200 brands including DTC (Warby Parker, Glossier, Allbirds), restaurant groups (Major Food Group, Balthazar, Via Carota), and premium retail (Moncler, Arc'teryx, Lululemon). Alfresco permits: 30-day lookback (was 7d), includes pending applications (not just approved) with appropriate "has applied for" language in stories. `OutdoorDiningEvent` has `isPending` flag.
- **NYC Open Data column name fixes:** Film permits API (`tg4x-b46p`) uses camelCase column names without underscores (e.g., `startdatetime` not `start_date_time`, `parkingheld` not `parking_held`). Alfresco API (`pitm-atqc`) uses `time_of_submission` not `time_submitted`, `bulding_number` (NYC typo) not `building`, seating interest values are `'sidewalk'`/`'both'` not `'yes'`. **Alfresco dataset stale since Aug 2023** — no new data available. Retail watch switched from stale BIS dataset (`ipu4-2q9a`, last updated 2018) to DOB NOW (`rbx6-tga4`) with `work_type='Sign'`.
- **Retail watch brand pattern false positives:** The `ald\b` shortcut in Aimé Leon Dore's regex matched any name ending in "ald" (Ronald, Gerald, Donald) in owner/applicant fields — every permit matched ALD. Removed `|ald\b`, tightened 12 other patterns (Vince, Theory, Apple, COS, Edition, Aman, Sandro, Creed, Rumble, RH, Barry's, Credo) to require brand-specific context words (e.g., `/\bapple\s*(store|retail|inc)\b/i`). Changed dedup from permit-ID-based to brand+address-based slug to prevent duplicate articles for same location.
- **AI writing persona architecture:** Three-tier model: (1) **Grok** = neutral fact-gatherer ("You are a local news/events researcher"), no writing-style constraints so it doesn't filter facts; (2) **Claude Sonnet** (6 cron prompts in route.ts files) = insider resident persona with writing-style rules (no em dashes, no slang, assume reader is local); (3) **Gemini Flash/Pro** (30+ lib files) = insider resident persona via shared `insiderPersona(location, role)` from `src/lib/ai-persona.ts`. Grok feeds raw facts to Gemini enrichment which applies the voice. The `insiderPersona()` utility prevents drift: "You are a well-travelled, successful 35-year-old who has lived in {location} for years..." with insider writing rules and banned outsider phrases ("for those in the know", "the elite", "Manhattan's elite", "if you know you know", "the usual suspects", "movers and shakers"). Never define separate persona constants in cron files - 6 crons had stale `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constants that lacked the banned phrases.
- **Grok-powered event crons (9 crons):** Shared `grokEventSearch()` utility in `grok.ts` (Responses API with `web_search` + `x_search`, temperature 0.5). Each cron's system prompt requests JSON array, caller parses with `raw.match(/\[[\s\S]*\]/)` then validates against existing configs (brand whitelists, venue lists, airline configs, Blue Chip keywords). **Batching constraint:** Each `grokEventSearch()` call takes 60-120s. Must batch all items into 1-2 calls per cron (not per-item) to stay under 300s Vercel timeout — prompt lists all items with a discriminating field (e.g., `"venue"`, `"city"`, `"house"`) in the JSON response for mapping back. For large item counts, split into 2 regional batches (Americas + Europe/Asia) via `Promise.all`. Crons: overture-alert (9 venues, 1 call), museum-watch (18 museums, 2 calls), sample-sale (5 cities, 1 call), gala-watch (9 hubs, 1 call), route-alert (8 hubs, 1 call), residency-radar (1 call), archive-hunter (~15 stores, 1 call), nyc-auctions (3 houses, 1 call), global-auctions (5 hubs × 3 houses, 2 calls). All preserve existing Gemini story generation + article insertion untouched.
- **political-wallet thresholds:** FEC API works but original thresholds were too restrictive. `LOOKBACK_DAYS` 7→30, `STORY_TRIGGER_THRESHOLD` $10K→$2.5K, `POWER_DONOR_THRESHOLD` $1K→$500.
- **heritage-filings fixes:** NYC DOB heritage filings had 24h lookback (too short for lagging dataset) — changed to 336h (14 days). Missing `nyc-` prefix on neighborhood IDs (same systemic bug as liquor-watch).
- **Liquor license cron rewrite:** Old cron used NY State dataset `wg8y-fzsj` requiring authentication (always 0 results). Switched to two public datasets: pending licenses (`f8i8-k2gm`) for new applications and active licenses (`9s3h-dpkz`) for recently granted. Full pipeline: fetch → filter newsworthy (restaurants, bars, hotels, clubs — skip grocery/manufacturer/wholesaler) → generate "Last Call" stories via Gemini Flash → create articles with brand+address dedup. Category labels: "Last Call: Application" / "Last Call: Approved". `NEIGHBORHOOD_ID_TO_CONFIG` keys lack `nyc-` prefix so `getNeighborhoodFromZip()` prepends it. Story generation parallelized in batches of 5. Uses placeholder image (not AI-generated) to stay within 120s function timeout.
- **Non-government single-source:** Text reads "This is a single-source story. It's always wise to double-check here" with "here" linking to Google Search (`headline + neighborhoodName`).

### Article Body Typography ("Effortless Legibility")
- **Font:** Merriweather (Google Fonts, screen-optimized serif) via `--font-body-serif` CSS variable, fallback Georgia/Times New Roman
- **Size:** Mobile `text-[1.2rem]` (~19px), Desktop `text-[1.35rem]` (~22px) - WSJ/New Yorker scale
- **Line height:** `leading-loose` (2x) - white on black needs more space to avoid bloom
- **Color:** `text-neutral-200` (off-white, never pure #FFFFFF on dark)
- **Paragraph spacing:** `mb-8` between paragraphs
- **Links:** Academic "invisible link" style - `text-current font-semibold underline decoration-dotted decoration-neutral-500/40 decoration-1 underline-offset-4`, hover: `decoration-solid decoration-neutral-300/60`. Markdown links `[text](url)` in content are rendered as clickable `<a>` tags. HTML `<a>` tags from AI output are converted to markdown format first. **Auto-linking disabled** - render-time entity detection and pipeline hyperlink injection both removed to avoid cluttered articles.
